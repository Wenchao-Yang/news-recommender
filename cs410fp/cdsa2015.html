        <p><strong class="orange">Carrie J. Anderson, </strong>an executive chef for <a href="http://www.housing.illinois.edu">University Housing</a> Dining Services, oversees the chefs and production staff members in residential dining. She also serves as a role model, mentor and teacher to many of these employees. </p>
        <p>Michael D. Clark, a clerk for University Housing who nominated Anderson, applauds her commitment and passion. &ldquo;Her collaborations, relationships with students and employees, and her vast passion and knowledge of food and people forms the very environment that the University of Illinois prides itself on â€“ an enriching experience that engages our future generations,&rdquo; he said.</p>
        <p>Anderson goes beyond her expected duties, Clark said. She has developed recipes for students with food allergies, taught cooking classes and attends culinary conferences to learn about menu trends and new preparation methods. </p>
        <p>Anderson also has developed relationships with other organizations at the U. of I. to create themed dinners and events, including the Lunar New Year Celebration with the Asian American Cultural Center and the Harvest Meal with the Native American Cultural Center. </p>
        <p>During Anderson&rsquo;s time at the university, the U. of I. Dining&rsquo;s Annual Chef&rsquo;s Challenge became an American Culinary Federation-sanctioned event in 2013. She also has received a bronze medal in the American Culinary Federation Sanctioned 2006 Tastes of the World Chef Culinary Conference at the University of Massachusetts. Most recently, she accepted FoodService Director magazine&rsquo;s request to be on its panel of 50 chefs.        </p>

        <p><strong class="orange">Mary J. Ellerbe, </strong>an office support specialist for <a href="http://www.asianam.illinois.edu">Asian American Studies</a>, is responsible for answering questions from students and visitors, scheduling classes, arranging for classroom space and supervising student workers.</p>
        <p>Christine Lyke, an office administrator for Asian American Studies, said Ellerbe is one of the most dedicated individuals on the U. of I. campus. She has served the unit since its inception in 1997, and was the only support staff member during a transitionary period during the academic year 2012-13. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s knowledge of the department and university, along with her diligent work ethic, helps her complete projects in a timely manner, handle problems and make good decisions with little supervision,&rdquo; Lyke said. </p>
        <p>Lyke said Ellerbe is dedicated to the department and her job, and Ellerbe constantly looks for ways to make the work environment pleasant for faculty members. &ldquo;The department can always count on her to be in attendance making sure that events run smoothly, guests are taken care of and students&rsquo; needs are met.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In addition, Soo Ah Kwon, a professor of Asian American Studies, said Ellerbe is the face and heart of their department and &ldquo;there is always a solution with Mary, no matter how difficult the situation may seem.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She goes beyond anyone in our department to promote positive morale by displaying a congenial, supportive attitude, and providing service to others.&rdquo;        </p>

        <p><strong class="orange">Diane K. Kiddoo </strong>was hired as the water station subforeman for <a href="http://www.housing.illinois.edu">University Housing</a> in 2013. Her responsibilities include assisting the building craftsmen supervisor with supervisory and administrative duties, along with operating and maintaining the water distribution systems, cooling towers and water softeners. She also works with all pest control operations.</p>
        <p>According to nominator Margaret Machele Caston, a water station operator for University Housing, dealing with pest issues is where Kiddoo shines.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She successfully relates with students and their parents when dealing with delicate pest issues, informing them of the facts of the situation and what will be done to resolve it,&rdquo; Caston said.</p>
        <p>In addition, Kiddoo trains building service workers to teach them about identifying and protecting themselves from pests, most notably bed bugs. She works to get Housing crafts and trades involved with the exclusion aspect of the Integrated Pest Management program, which includes physically keeping pests out, such as by adding a door sweep or fixing a window screen. </p>
        <p>In addition, after much hard work and an on-site evaluation, Housing earned Green Shield Certification by the IPM Institute of North America,Â becoming only the second institution of higher education to earn this certification. </p>
        <p>For the past two years, Kiddoo has attended the Midwest Association of Higher Education Facilities Officers conference as a speaker, teaching Housing&rsquo;s integrated pest management techniques to other universities.        </p>

        <p><strong class="orange">Jessica R. Risley, </strong>a veterinary technician specialist in the department of anesthesiology and pain management for the <a href="http://vetmed.illinois.edu/vth/">Veterinary Teaching Hospital</a>, performs duties similar to those of a certified registered nurse anesthetist at a hospital for people. Risley works toward giving her patients the highest standard of care in the intensive care unit. She also manages technicians, residents and an intern. </p>
        <p>Ashley Mitek, a veterinary resident for the department of veterinary clinical medicine who nominated Risley, said she goes beyond her assigned job responsibilities and will stay after hours to help a recovering patient or to start an emergency case. </p>
        <p>She said other specialists constantly look to Risley for advice and help.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;In a crisis, Jessica is calm and quickly troubleshoots the problem to save lives,&rdquo; Mitek said. </p>
        <p>Risley is one of 186 technicians in the United States who has earned the certification of Veterinary Technician Specialist (Anesthesia) after passing a rigorous examination, demonstrating advanced skills, and logging thousands of critical anesthesia cases. She has taught more than 1,000 veterinary students and has anesthetized 7,800 client-owned cats and dogs, 1,000 cats and dogs from humane societies, and eight tigers from when she worked at an exotic feline rescue center. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I admire her character and willingness to go above and beyond what is necessary to help others make it through the ups and downs of life,&rdquo; Mitek said.        </p>

        <p><strong class="orange">Douglas V. Robertson, </strong>a building service worker for <a href="http://www.fs.illinois.edu">Facilities and Services</a>, does his job admirably, always with a smile and a willingness to go above and beyond what is required. </p>
        <p>His duties involve ordering supplies, caring and maintaining for equipment, reporting needed repairs, seasonally removing snow from building entrances, emptying waste containers and restocking supplies. </p>
        <p>Carla E. Caceres, the director for the School of Integrative Biology and a professor of animal biology, said Robertson is very respectful of the lab space and of those working in Morrill Hall. The hall houses plants, animals and insects, and there are multiple restrictions in place regarding the types of cleaning products and procedures that may be used.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Doug has worked to form personal relationships with the scientists in the building. He has been most respectful of lab and office space, asking occupants what can and cannot be cleaned,&rdquo; Caceres said. &ldquo;As a result, both Doug and the faculty and students feel that their labs are cleaned appropriately, without doing harm to the scholarship in the space.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>Caceres said Robertson maintains a positive attitude.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Doug&rsquo;s attitude is such that everyone wants to work with him to keep the building clean, and his high standards and attention to details add the extra sparkle to our home,&rdquo; Caceres said.        </p>

        <p><span class="orange"><strong>Kathryn D. Schilson,</strong></span> an office administrator for the <a href="http://www.spanport.illinois.edu">department of Spanish and Portuguese</a> in the <a href="http://www.slcl.illinois.edu">School of Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics</a>, is the sole executive officer support person for the head of the department and for the director of Second Language Acquisition and Teacher Education. She also has administrative responsibilities for the University Language Academy for Children, which provides Spanish-language instruction to children at University Primary School. She works on appointment paperwork for faculty members and graduate students, arranges course schedules, and makes travel and purchasing arrangements for the department. </p>
        <p>Melissa A. Bowles, a professor of Spanish and Portuguese and the director of graduate studies, said she believes Schilson&rsquo;s title as office administrator does not do justice to the &ldquo;multitude of responsibilities she takes on and the innovation she shows in her work.&rdquo; Bowles said the department of Spanish and Portuguese formerly had four support staff members, but now Schilson &ldquo;literally does the job that those four used to do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She has graciously and humbly been providing excellent service to the university for more than 20 years,&rdquo; Bowles said. </p>
        <p>Bowles said Schilson constantly looks for ways to improve the department.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have asked if she had any suggestions for improving the way we do things, and in every case, she has had valuable feedback that has ultimately simplified processes and made them more transparent for students, faculty and staff, alike,&rdquo; Bowles said.        </p>

        <p><strong class="orange">Virginia G. Swisher, </strong>an office support specialist for the <a href="http://www.gws.illinois.edu">department of gender and women&rsquo;s studies</a>, approaches new tasks with enthusiasm and volunteers for additional work, according to Stephanie Foote, the department chair and a professor of English. </p>
        <p>Foote said when Swisher first took on work in the department, the unit had been going through difficult changes, but Swisher energetically stepped into the position.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will always be grateful to her for filling that void, and for shouldering additional work so that others could put their families and their health first,&rdquo; Foote said. </p>
        <p>The small department and small staff means workers must take on multiple roles, and they must constantly learn and relearn their jobs, Foote said. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Fortunately for GWS, Virginia is always up for that challenge,&rdquo; she said. </p>
        <p>Swisher&rsquo;s job duties range widely and include updating the department website, purchasing supplies and maintaining inventories, scheduling equipment and building maintenance, processing reimbursements as well as making faculty purchases (books, travel and accommodations), maintaining calendars for the chair and the unit, ordering textbooks and inputting courses into Banner, creating the course guide and managing the logistics of departmental event programming. </p>
        <p>Foote is grateful to have Swisher in the department.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Virginia says that she loves her job and looks forward to coming to work every day. In that sense, she is fortunate â€“ but not nearly as fortunate as GWS is to have her,&rdquo; Foote said.        </p>

        <p><strong class="orange">Brian K. Woller, </strong>a lab animal caretaker for the <a href="http://vetmed.illinois.edu/vth/">Veterinary Teaching Hospital</a>, is responsible for the overall care of small pets, horses, cattle or other farm animals. </p>
        <p>Dennis D. French, a professor of veterinary clinical medicine, said he is impressed with Woller&rsquo;s ability to quickly troubleshoot and solve problems while never appearing to be overwhelmed during demanding situations. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Brian is routinely working to improve the workflow and cleanliness of our hospital, as well as organizing our student employees with regard to their work schedule and how they manage their hours,&rdquo; French said. &ldquo;I have been excited and exhilarated to observe Mr. Woller&rsquo;s initiative and suggestions for new work methods that increase productivity within our hospital setting. He has taken steps to identify various tools that enhance our environment and ability to maintain bio-secure areas, as well as saving time and money for the university.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Woller is dedicated to his work and those he serves, according to Cynthia Pruitt.</p>
        <p>Pruitt, an office administrator for the Agricultural Animal Care and Use Program, said Woller makes sure the animals are cared for, and he offers suggestions and creative ideas to manage the animals.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;With a huge reduction in staffing of the Large Animal Clinic caretakers over the last few years, excellence and perfection could easily take a back seat, but not with Brian,&rdquo; Pruitt said. </p>
