<p>The Eleventh Congress will be built around the changes that are occurring in the field of qualitative inquiry (QI) (and ICQI) since the Congress was launched as an alternative site for collaboration and discourse. It is time to take stock, time to go back to the future, time to ask if it is time to begin constructing a new critical qualitative inquiry, a time to undo the past, time to re-think taken-for granted paradigms, frameworks, epistemologies, methodologies, ethics and the politics of inquiry.</p>

description : <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />TBA</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Karla Mallette studies communications between literary traditions in the medieval Mediterranean&mdash;especially Arabic and the Romance vernaculars&mdash;and the way that we remember that history today. Her first book, <em>The Kingdom of Sicily, 1100-1250: A Literary History</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), traced the transition between Arabic and Italian literary traditions in medieval Sicily; her second, <em>European Modernity and the Arab Mediterranean</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), focused on a southern European tradition of scholarship that identifies the origins of modernity in the contact between Islamic and Christian civilizations in the medieval Mediterranean. Her current project, tentatively titled&nbsp;<em>Lives of the Great Languages: Cosmopolitan Languages in the Medieval Mediterranean</em>, studies the strategies that language uses to transcend the boundaries that language creates. By profiling two pre-modern cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and Latin, and acknowledging the emergent cosmopolitan languages of the twenty-first century, the book contextualizes and defamiliarizes the national language system of European modernity. She has published essays on medieval translations of Aristotelian philosophy, framed narratives, European Orientalism, and Mediterranean Studies, in addition to Italian literature.</p>

title : Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Evolution of Soviet Empire
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/1213/32706929
description : <p>Following the history of Georgians beyond the Georgian republic from 1917 to the present, this presentation explores the rise and fall of the Soviet multiethnic empire from the perspective of its most prominent internal diaspora. Joseph Stalin (Jughashvili) was just one of a group of Georgian revolutionaries who came to power in the early years of Soviet rule and directed the development of the new state. After the socialist state was established, Soviet citizens sought new opportunities for leisure and consumption and found them at the Georgian restaurant, where they adopted the distinctive rituals of the Georgian table. During Khrushchev&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thaw,&rdquo; Georgian cultural entrepreneurs embodied the era&rsquo;s spirit of spontaneity as popular ethnic entertainers specializing in song, dance, and theater. As official life grew stagnant under Brezhnev, Georgians thrived in the burgeoning informal economy. Finally, with the advent of Gorbachev&rsquo;s reforms, it was a Georgian film, <em>Repentance</em>, that explored the furthest limits of allowable expression, calling into question the very legitimacy of Soviet power. The prominence of the Georgian diaspora suggests that the Soviet Union was not simply a Russian empire, nor merely a multiethnic state composed of separate nations; instead, it was an empire of diasporas, where politics, culture, and economics were constituted by the mixing of a diverse array of mobile nationalities.</p>
<p><strong>Erik R. Scott</strong> is Assistant Professor of Russian and Soviet history at the University of Kansas. Drawing on years of fieldwork and knowledge of several regional languages, his research and teaching explore migration and diaspora within and beyond the imperial borders of Russia and Eurasia. His book, <em>Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Multiethnic Soviet Empire </em>(forthcoming from Oxford University Press in 2016), reimagines the Soviet empire by revealing how external borders concealed an array of specialized internal diaspora populations. He has recently begun a new project on Soviet defectors and the production of Cold War borders, focusing in particular on the winding journeys of defectors through border zones, transit hubs, extraterritorial spaces, and contested areas beyond the limits of state jurisdiction. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on Russian and Soviet history, the Cold War, comparative empires, and migration in global perspective. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2011 and was the Post-Doctoral Fellow in Caucasian and Central Asian Affairs at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies from 2011 to 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Karla Mallette studies communications between literary traditions in the medieval Mediterranean&mdash;especially Arabic and the Romance vernaculars&mdash;and the way that we remember that history today. Her first book, <em>The Kingdom of Sicily, 1100-1250: A Literary History</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), traced the transition between Arabic and Italian literary traditions in medieval Sicily; her second, <em>European Modernity and the Arab Mediterranean</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), focused on a southern European tradition of scholarship that identifies the origins of modernity in the contact between Islamic and Christian civilizations in the medieval Mediterranean. Her current project, tentatively titled&nbsp;<em>Lives of the Great Languages: Cosmopolitan Languages in the Medieval Mediterranean</em>, studies the strategies that language uses to transcend the boundaries that language creates. By profiling two pre-modern cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and Latin, and acknowledging the emergent cosmopolitan languages of the twenty-first century, the book contextualizes and defamiliarizes the national language system of European modernity. She has published essays on medieval translations of Aristotelian philosophy, framed narratives, European Orientalism, and Mediterranean Studies, in addition to Italian literature.</p>

title : Lecture: Cosmopolitan Language Systems in the Mediterranean
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/1889/32574279
description : <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />TBA</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Karla Mallette studies communications between literary traditions in the medieval Mediterranean&mdash;especially Arabic and the Romance vernaculars&mdash;and the way that we remember that history today. Her first book, <em>The Kingdom of Sicily, 1100-1250: A Literary History</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), traced the transition between Arabic and Italian literary traditions in medieval Sicily; her second, <em>European Modernity and the Arab Mediterranean</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), focused on a southern European tradition of scholarship that identifies the origins of modernity in the contact between Islamic and Christian civilizations in the medieval Mediterranean. Her current project, tentatively titled&nbsp;<em>Lives of the Great Languages: Cosmopolitan Languages in the Medieval Mediterranean</em>, studies the strategies that language uses to transcend the boundaries that language creates. By profiling two pre-modern cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and Latin, and acknowledging the emergent cosmopolitan languages of the twenty-first century, the book contextualizes and defamiliarizes the national language system of European modernity.

Lecture: Cosmopolitan Language Systems in the Mediterranean Abstract: TBA Bio: Karla Mallette studies communications between literary traditions in the medieval Mediterranean—especially Arabic and the Romance vernaculars—and the way that we remember that history today. Her first book, The Kingdom of Sicily, 1100-1250: A Literary History (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), traced the transition between Arabic and Italian literary traditions in medieval Sicily; her second, European Modernity and the Arab Mediterranean (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), focused on a southern European tradition of scholarship that identifies the origins of modernity in the contact between Islamic and Christian civilizations in the medieval Mediterranean. Her current project, tentatively titled Lives of the Great Languages: Cosmopolitan Languages in the Medieval Mediterranean, studies the strategies that language uses to transcend the boundaries that language creates. By profiling two pre-modern cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and Latin, and acknowledging the emergent cosmopolitan languages of the twenty-first century, the book contextualizes and defamiliarizes the national language system of European modernity. She has published essays on medieval translations of Aristotelian philosophy, framed narratives, European Orientalism, and Mediterranean Studies, in addition to Italian literature.

title : Discovering Late Victorian East St. Louis: Urban Archaeology and the New Mississippi River Bridge Project
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/2195/32550491
description : <p>Between 2009 and 2012, teams of archaeologists from the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS) conducted large-scale excavations in East St. Louis as part of the New Mississippi River Bridge Project. The recovered artifacts and information, combined with archival research, are yielding new insights into the history of East St. Louis, particularly about the daily lives of working-class individuals and families from the time when the city was a booming transportation and manufacturing hub. The project&rsquo;s path cut through former residential neighborhoods and remnants of the St. Louis National Stockyards, which lead to the recovery of thousands of artifacts from privies, cisterns, wells, and cellars. This presentation examines the excavation and material culture associated with this Late Victorian East St.Louis working class neighborhood.</p>

title : PREMIER: Probabilistic Error-correction using Markov Inference in Errored Reads
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/2232/32706308
description : <p>Next generation DNA sequencing is a technology that is revolutionizing research in biology and medicine. The sequencers operate by randomly fragmenting a genome into reads (contiguous genome fragments) that are a few hundred of base pairs long. Reads are produced at a much higher throughput compared to classical techniques. However, they are often corrupted by errors which pose a serious problem for downstream processes such as genome assembly. Correcting errors in reads is thus an important problem. The problem differs significantly from classical error correction since there is a lack of alignment information between the different reads. We present a fully flexible, probabilistic and reference-free method of error correction for high throughput DNA sequencing data. The outputs of a sequencer are modeled as independent emissions of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where transition probabilities account for local dependence in the genome and the emission distribution models the error properties of the sequencer. We pose the problem of error correction of reads as one of maximum likelihood sequence detection over this HMM. Exhaustive results on publicly available datasets show that our algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of error correction performance.</p>

The partnerships and infrastructure are expected to evolve around four regions (South, Northeast, Midwest and West) and NSF is calling for the creation of four Regional Innovation Big Data Hubs. Phase 1 of this effort began with a solicitation (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15562/nsf15562.htm) in which NSF expects to fund up to four proposals (one from each region).<br /><br />Illinois is directing the effort for the Midwest Regional Big Data Innovation Hub with Ed Seidel, Director of NCSA and Klara Nahrstedt, Director of the Coordinated Science Laboratory in the College of Engineering, as leads. Our proposal is being written in collaboration with many organizations across the Midwest covering the broad Big Data challenges of the Midwest, which then academia, industry, foundations, and non-profit organizations can assist to solve. More information will be available as the process unfolds at https://bdhub.info/<br /><br />At Illinois, Klara and Ed are seeking knowledge and input for the proposal from researchers who use Big Data in their domains and who would like to see a broad regional and national alliance develop solutions to the challenges of Big Data. <br /><br />To facilitate researchers' input at Illinois, Klara and Ed are organizing two informational meetings on our campus to inform interested faculty about the possibilities, including ways to contribute and provide input to the proposal and to join the Big Data alliance in Midwest (and nationally). In both meetings, they will present NSF goals for this Big Data initiative and the process Illinois will follow in writing the Midwest Regional Big Data Hub proposal, followed by open discussion. The research areas addressed in these two meetings will not be identical, but rather will cover distinct topics as outlined below.<br /><br />The first Big Data Hub Informational Talk is scheduled from 9-11 a.m. Wednesday, May 13, in the Institute for Genomic Biology's Room 612. Topical discussion will address potential faculty participation and contributions in the areas of Food-Water-Energy Nexus, Genomics, Bioinformatics, Life Sciences, Health Sciences and Digital Agriculture. <br /><br />The second Big Data Hub Informational Talk is scheduled for 1-3 p.m. Thursday, May 21, in the NCSA Auditorium.

description : <p>The National Science Foundation is launching a 10-year effort to create partnerships around Big Data and the management infrastructure for Big Data. The partnerships and infrastructure are expected to evolve around four regions (South, Northeast, Midwest and West) and NSF is calling for the creation of four Regional Innovation Big Data Hubs. Phase 1 of this effort began with a solicitation (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15562/nsf15562.htm) in which NSF expects to fund up to four proposals (one from each region).<br /><br />Illinois is directing the effort for the Midwest Regional Big Data Innovation Hub with Ed Seidel, Director of NCSA and Klara Nahrstedt, Director of the Coordinated Science Laboratory in the College of Engineering, as leads. Our proposal is being written in collaboration with many organizations across the Midwest covering the broad Big Data challenges of the Midwest, which then academia, industry, foundations, and non-profit organizations can assist to solve. More information will be available as the process unfolds at https://bdhub.info/<br /><br />At Illinois, Klara and Ed are seeking knowledge and input for the proposal from researchers who use Big Data in their domains and who would like to see a broad regional and national alliance develop solutions to the challenges of Big Data. <br /><br />To facilitate researchers' input at Illinois, Klara and Ed are organizing two informational meetings on our campus to inform interested faculty about the possibilities, including ways to contribute and provide input to the proposal and to join the Big Data alliance in Midwest (and nationally). In both meetings, they will present NSF goals for this Big Data initiative and the process Illinois will follow in writing the Midwest Regional Big Data Hub proposal, followed by open discussion. The research areas addressed in these two meetings will not be identical, but rather will cover distinct topics as outlined below.<br /><br />The first Big Data Hub Informational Talk is scheduled from 9-11 a.m. Wednesday, May 13, in the Institute for Genomic Biology's Room 612. Topical discussion will address potential faculty participation and contributions in the areas of Food-Water-Energy Nexus, Genomics, Bioinformatics, Life Sciences, Health Sciences and Digital Agriculture. <br /><br />The second Big Data Hub Informational Talk is scheduled for 1-3 p.m. Thursday, May 21, in the NCSA Auditorium. Topical discussion will be in the areas of Smart Cities, Advanced Manufacturing, Network Science, Transportation, IT Tools and Services, and Data Science. <br /><br />We hope to see you at one of the Informational Talks and to foster broad participation of Illinois faculty in creating Big Data partnerships and infrastructures both across the Midwest and nationally.<br /><br />If you have questions, please contact Kandace Turner-Jones at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ktrnrjns@illinois.edu">ktrnrjns@illinois.edu</a> or 217-300-2042.</p>

title : Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Evolution of Soviet Empire
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/2754/32706929
description : <p>Following the history of Georgians beyond the Georgian republic from 1917 to the present, this presentation explores the rise and fall of the Soviet multiethnic empire from the perspective of its most prominent internal diaspora. Joseph Stalin (Jughashvili) was just one of a group of Georgian revolutionaries who came to power in the early years of Soviet rule and directed the development of the new state. After the socialist state was established, Soviet citizens sought new opportunities for leisure and consumption and found them at the Georgian restaurant, where they adopted the distinctive rituals of the Georgian table. During Khrushchev&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thaw,&rdquo; Georgian cultural entrepreneurs embodied the era&rsquo;s spirit of spontaneity as popular ethnic entertainers specializing in song, dance, and theater. As official life grew stagnant under Brezhnev, Georgians thrived in the burgeoning informal economy. Finally, with the advent of Gorbachev&rsquo;s reforms, it was a Georgian film, <em>Repentance</em>, that explored the furthest limits of allowable expression, calling into question the very legitimacy of Soviet power. The prominence of the Georgian diaspora suggests that the Soviet Union was not simply a Russian empire, nor merely a multiethnic state composed of separate nations; instead, it was an empire of diasporas, where politics, culture, and economics were constituted by the mixing of a diverse array of mobile nationalities.</p>
<p><strong>Erik R. Scott</strong> is Assistant Professor of Russian and Soviet history at the University of Kansas. Drawing on years of fieldwork and knowledge of several regional languages, his research and teaching explore migration and diaspora within and beyond the imperial borders of Russia and Eurasia. His book, <em>Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Multiethnic Soviet Empire </em>(forthcoming from Oxford University Press in 2016), reimagines the Soviet empire by revealing how external borders concealed an array of specialized internal diaspora populations. He has recently begun a new project on Soviet defectors and the production of Cold War borders, focusing in particular on the winding journeys of defectors through border zones, transit hubs, extraterritorial spaces, and contested areas beyond the limits of state jurisdiction. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on Russian and Soviet history, the Cold War, comparative empires, and migration in global perspective. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2011 and was the Post-Doctoral Fellow in Caucasian and Central Asian Affairs at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies from 2011 to 2012.</p>

title : Digital and Technology Access: the Role of Law I the Limits of Law
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/2951/32541687
description : <p>This session will explore the role of the law in advancing digital accessibility in the United States. The ADA doesn't mention websites or the Internet. Does it matter? Court decisions, voluntary settlements, advocacy by the Department of Justice and Department of Education and new regulations are making the digital environment more accessible. But is it enough? Participants in this webinar will learn about recent litigation, Structured Negotiations, and administrative actions making websites, mobile applications and other technology available to people with disabilities. We'll talk about how the ADA and other state and federal laws can advance digital inclusion and the various strategies that advocates have at their disposal to effectively use those laws. We'll look at the law's role in expanding digital access in education, finance, healthcare, retail and more. Can effective use of the law help close the digital divide? What do you think? There will be plenty of time for questions and answers. Participants will learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>What laws (in the U.S.) require digital accessibility and how are they being Implemented</li>
<li>What does the U.S. Department of Justice have to say about digital accessibility</li>
<li>Does the law protect the privacy of financial and health information for people with disabilities.&nbsp;</li>

title : Turning Text Into Speech: Real World Applications and Examples
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/2951/32541689
description : <p>Computers these days have a lot to say but only if you know the right way to ask them. With text-to-speech a user can have the computer read almost any text out loud. This can be a life changing tool for people who are blind, low vision, or have a print related disability. But what are these tools, how do they work, and what does it look like in real life for an everyday user? In this Webinar we will explore text-to-speech tools available on computers, tablets, and smart phones through the use of real world examples. <br /> <br /> As a trainer of blind and low vision computer users Jonathan has gained a significant amount of hands-on experience of text-to-speech technology and will demonstrate the way his clients find success with text-to-speech tools. You&rsquo;ll also learn how people with print related disables like dyslexia can leverage these tools to find success. Demonstrations will include: <br /> </p>
<ul>
<li>Screen readers like JAWS for Windows and VoiceOver for Apple devices</li>
<li>Text-to-Speech and magnification software like ZoomText and MAGic</li>
<li>Built-in reading tools on the iPad and iPhone like Speak Selection and Speak Screen</li>
<li>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software like the KNFB Reader and ABBYY FineReader</li>
<li>Highlight and read tools like NaturalReader and Snap&amp;Read</li>
<li>and more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Demonstrations will include both paid and free software options.</p>

description : <p>Accessibility can sometimes be very abstract and we might not completely understand how users with disabilities will be affected by our designs or if we&rsquo;ve implemented a technique correctly. The monthly "Explore with Hadi" meeting is a place where we can evaluate these things together, identify any issues and hopefully find solutions together to address accessibility/usability issues.</p>
<p>The Explore with Hadi discussion is held on the second Tuesday of each month. It is an informal gathering where web developers can bring their accessibility questions to an open dialog. We will examine how potential accessibility issues in the web development process can impact a wide range of disabilities. This includes looking at the overall design, determining how screen reading software shows the page, discuss usability issues and best practices using HTML/CSS/Javascript and how to incorporate the latest accessibility techniques like WAI ARIA. We strive to present an overall universal design approach to help you not only improve web sites and applications but also gain a more informed understanding of what that takes.</p>
<p>All of this takes place in a friendly, comfortable environment where we will even offer coffee and refreshments! The discussion is always instructive and helpful in bringing best practices and techniques to light in a practical, hands-on format. If you can&rsquo;t participate physically, joining by phone is also possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>2nd Tuesday of each month</li>
<li>11:00 AM to 12:00 PM</li>
<li>Location and phone-in information is provided in announcements on the CCSP, Webmaster, and Accessibility mailing lists&nbsp;approximately one week prior to the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Explore with Hadi is primarily targeted to campus developers, we also welcome developers from the community. If you are interested in getting involved in&nbsp;our discussion,&nbsp;we recommend you join the&nbsp;<a href="https://lists.illinois.edu/lists/info/accessibility" target="_blank">Accessibility mailing list</a>&nbsp;so you will receive our monthly announcements.

description : <p>Accessibility can sometimes be very abstract and we might not completely understand how users with disabilities will be affected by our designs or if we&rsquo;ve implemented a technique correctly. The monthly "Explore with Hadi" meeting is a place where we can evaluate these things together, identify any issues and hopefully find solutions together to address accessibility/usability issues.</p>
<p>The Explore with Hadi discussion is held on the second Tuesday of each month. It is an informal gathering where web developers can bring their accessibility questions to an open dialog. We will examine how potential accessibility issues in the web development process can impact a wide range of disabilities. This includes looking at the overall design, determining how screen reading software shows the page, discuss usability issues and best practices using HTML/CSS/Javascript and how to incorporate the latest accessibility techniques like WAI ARIA. We strive to present an overall universal design approach to help you not only improve web sites and applications but also gain a more informed understanding of what that takes.</p>
<p>All of this takes place in a friendly, comfortable environment where we will even offer coffee and refreshments! The discussion is always instructive and helpful in bringing best practices and techniques to light in a practical, hands-on format. If you can&rsquo;t participate physically, joining by phone is also possible.</p>

description : <p>Accessibility can sometimes be very abstract and we might not completely understand how users with disabilities will be affected by our designs or if we&rsquo;ve implemented a technique correctly. The monthly "Explore with Hadi" meeting is a place where we can evaluate these things together, identify any issues and hopefully find solutions together to address accessibility/usability issues.</p>
<p>The Explore with Hadi discussion is held on the second Tuesday of each month. It is an informal gathering where web developers can bring their accessibility questions to an open dialog. We will examine how potential accessibility issues in the web development process can impact a wide range of disabilities. This includes looking at the overall design, determining how screen reading software shows the page, discuss usability issues and best practices using HTML/CSS/Javascript and how to incorporate the latest accessibility techniques like WAI ARIA. We strive to present an overall universal design approach to help you not only improve web sites and applications but also gain a more informed understanding of what that takes.</p>
<p>All of this takes place in a friendly, comfortable environment where we will even offer coffee and refreshments! The discussion is always instructive and helpful in bringing best practices and techniques to light in a practical, hands-on format. If you can&rsquo;t participate physically, joining by phone is also possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>2nd Tuesday of each month</li>
<li>11:00 AM to 12:00 PM</li>
<li>Location and phone-in information is provided in announcements on the CCSP, Webmaster, and Accessibility mailing lists&nbsp;approximately one week prior to the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Explore with Hadi is primarily targeted to campus developers, we also welcome developers from the community. If you are interested in getting involved in&nbsp;our discussion,&nbsp;we recommend you join the&nbsp;<a href="https://lists.illinois.edu/lists/info/accessibility" target="_blank">Accessibility mailing list</a>&nbsp;so you will receive our monthly announcements.

title : Faculty input meeting on regional Big Data Hub
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/3051/32712115
description : <p>The National Science Foundation is launching a 10-year effort to create partnerships around Big Data and the management infrastructure for Big Data. The partnerships and infrastructure are expected to evolve around four regions (South, Northeast, Midwest and West) and NSF is calling for the creation of four Regional Innovation Big Data Hubs. Phase 1 of this effort began with a solicitation (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15562/nsf15562.htm) in which NSF expects to fund up to four proposals (one from each region).<br /><br />Illinois is directing the effort for the Midwest Regional Big Data Innovation Hub with Ed Seidel, Director of NCSA and Klara Nahrstedt, Director of the Coordinated Science Laboratory in the College of Engineering, as leads. Our proposal is being written in collaboration with many organizations across the Midwest covering the broad Big Data challenges of the Midwest, which then academia, industry, foundations, and non-profit organizations can assist to solve. More information will be available as the process unfolds at https://bdhub.info/<br /><br />At Illinois, Klara and Ed are seeking knowledge and input for the proposal from researchers who use Big Data in their domains and who would like to see a broad regional and national alliance develop solutions to the challenges of Big Data. <br /><br />To facilitate researchers' input at Illinois, Klara and Ed are organizing two informational meetings on our campus to inform interested faculty about the possibilities, including ways to contribute and provide input to the proposal and to join the Big Data alliance in Midwest (and nationally). In both meetings, they will present NSF goals for this Big Data initiative and the process Illinois will follow in writing the Midwest Regional Big Data Hub proposal, followed by open discussion. The research areas addressed in these two meetings will not be identical, but rather will cover distinct topics as outlined below.<br /><br />The first Big Data Hub Informational Talk is scheduled from 9-11 a.m. Wednesday, May 13, in the Institute for Genomic Biology's Room 612. Topical discussion will address potential faculty participation and contributions in the areas of Food-Water-Energy Nexus, Genomics, Bioinformatics, Life Sciences, Health Sciences and Digital Agriculture. <br /><br />The second Big Data Hub Informational Talk is scheduled for 1-3 p.m. Thursday, May 21, in the NCSA Auditorium. Topical discussion will be in the areas of Smart Cities, Advanced Manufacturing, Network Science, Transportation, IT Tools and Services, and Data Science. <br /><br />We hope to see you at one of the Informational Talks and to foster broad participation of Illinois faculty in creating Big Data partnerships and infrastructures both across the Midwest and nationally.<br /><br />If you have questions, please contact Kandace Turner-Jones at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ktrnrjns@illinois.edu">ktrnrjns@illinois.edu</a> or 217-300-2042.</p>

title : Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Evolution of Soviet Empire
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/3058/32706929
description : <p>Following the history of Georgians beyond the Georgian republic from 1917 to the present, this presentation explores the rise and fall of the Soviet multiethnic empire from the perspective of its most prominent internal diaspora. Joseph Stalin (Jughashvili) was just one of a group of Georgian revolutionaries who came to power in the early years of Soviet rule and directed the development of the new state. After the socialist state was established, Soviet citizens sought new opportunities for leisure and consumption and found them at the Georgian restaurant, where they adopted the distinctive rituals of the Georgian table. During Khrushchev&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thaw,&rdquo; Georgian cultural entrepreneurs embodied the era&rsquo;s spirit of spontaneity as popular ethnic entertainers specializing in song, dance, and theater. As official life grew stagnant under Brezhnev, Georgians thrived in the burgeoning informal economy. Finally, with the advent of Gorbachev&rsquo;s reforms, it was a Georgian film, <em>Repentance</em>, that explored the furthest limits of allowable expression, calling into question the very legitimacy of Soviet power. The prominence of the Georgian diaspora suggests that the Soviet Union was not simply a Russian empire, nor merely a multiethnic state composed of separate nations; instead, it was an empire of diasporas, where politics, culture, and economics were constituted by the mixing of a diverse array of mobile nationalities.</p>
<p><strong>Erik R. Scott</strong> is Assistant Professor of Russian and Soviet history at the University of Kansas. Drawing on years of fieldwork and knowledge of several regional languages, his research and teaching explore migration and diaspora within and beyond the imperial borders of Russia and Eurasia. His book, <em>Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Multiethnic Soviet Empire </em>(forthcoming from Oxford University Press in 2016), reimagines the Soviet empire by revealing how external borders concealed an array of specialized internal diaspora populations. He has recently begun a new project on Soviet defectors and the production of Cold War borders, focusing in particular on the winding journeys of defectors through border zones, transit hubs, extraterritorial spaces, and contested areas beyond the limits of state jurisdiction. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on Russian and Soviet history, the Cold War, comparative empires, and migration in global perspective. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2011 and was the Post-Doctoral Fellow in Caucasian and Central Asian Affairs at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies from 2011 to 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Karla Mallette studies communications between literary traditions in the medieval Mediterranean&mdash;especially Arabic and the Romance vernaculars&mdash;and the way that we remember that history today. Her first book, <em>The Kingdom of Sicily, 1100-1250: A Literary History</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), traced the transition between Arabic and Italian literary traditions in medieval Sicily; her second, <em>European Modernity and the Arab Mediterranean</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), focused on a southern European tradition of scholarship that identifies the origins of modernity in the contact between Islamic and Christian civilizations in the medieval Mediterranean. Her current project, tentatively titled&nbsp;<em>Lives of the Great Languages: Cosmopolitan Languages in the Medieval Mediterranean</em>, studies the strategies that language uses to transcend the boundaries that language creates. By profiling two pre-modern cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and Latin, and acknowledging the emergent cosmopolitan languages of the twenty-first century, the book contextualizes and defamiliarizes the national language system of European modernity. She has published essays on medieval translations of Aristotelian philosophy, framed narratives, European Orientalism, and Mediterranean Studies, in addition to Italian literature.</p>

title : Webinar: Provenance and DataONE: Facilitating Reproducible Science
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/3090/32690983
description : <p>Provenance is a form of metadata that describes the lineage and processing history of data and knowledge artifacts and plays an important role in many scientific applications and use cases. For example, an ecologist might want to combine different datasets for a study, but needs to know how the candidate datasets were derived. A climate scientist might need to document the processing history of climate model outputs to facilitate reproducibility. A natural history collection manager might want to run automated data curation tools on specimen collection data, but has to understand the proposed &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; before executing them. In all these and many other cases like these, provenance information plays a crucial role. In this webinar, we will first give an overview of the different types of provenance information and how they can be used, e.g., to facilitate reproducible science.</p>
<p>We will show how a DataONE user can search and navigate provenance information using the new UI currently under development in DataONE. After this user-oriented view on provenance, we finally take a look &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; of the DataONE provenance technologies and present plans for future developments.</p>

description : <p>Between 2009 and 2012, teams of archaeologists from the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS) conducted large-scale excavations in East St. Louis as part of the New Mississippi River Bridge Project. The recovered artifacts and information, combined with archival research, are yielding new insights into the history of East St. Louis, particularly about the daily lives of working-class individuals and families from the time when the city was a booming transportation and manufacturing hub. The project&rsquo;s path cut through former residential neighborhoods and remnants of the St. Louis National Stockyards, which lead to the recovery of thousands of artifacts from privies, cisterns, wells, and cellars. This presentation examines the excavation and material culture associated with this Late Victorian East St.Louis working class neighborhood.</p>

In addition to a new location, this will be the first ABC conference to adopt a trauma-informed &lsquo;lens&rsquo;, and focus on the pervasive effects of trauma as they relate to all disciplines serving children and their families, especially children with special needs. Trauma is a widespread public health issue whose implications are not limited to the behavioral health sector. Therefore, this conference emphasizes a multidisciplinary, interprofessional approach to most effectively serve people who have experienced trauma. We invite you and your colleagues to join pediatricians, family physicians, healthcare professionals and community service providers, including home visitors, child care providers, Early Intervention professionals, social workers, and family case management, for a day of excellent educational content and networking with colleagues throughout the state. Throughout the day, three educational tracks (A, B, and C) will run concurrently in important breakout sessions. In addition ICAAP is pleased to announce that participants will gain valuable insights from three keynote speakers, as well as important resources from a variety of exhibitors.</p>

We encourage Scholars to tackle important questions that will advance theory, policy, and practice for youth. Applicants identify new methods, disciplines, or content they want to learn, and propose five-year research plans that foster their growth in those areas. We recognize that early-career researchers are rarely given incentives or support to take such risks, so this award includes a mentoring component. Potential Scholars should have a promising track record of conducting high-quality research, but want to pursue a significant shift in their trajectories as researchers.</p>

To do this, ECR projects are grounded in theory, ask well formulated research questions, employ relevant data and analytic techniques, and contribute to the growing body of literature on STEM education research. ECR projects bring together the expertise, literatures, methods and learning priorities of the entire range of scientific communities represented by the NSF research directorates as well as EHR. ECR supports researchers who use large scale, next generation data resources and relevant big data analytic techniques to advance fundamental research in STEM learning, STEM learning environments, STEM workforce development, and broadening participation research where appropriate. ECR also supports research on efforts to make that knowledge available to other researchers, education developers, leaders and practitioners so that research is used broadly to improve STEM education and the development of a flexible, knowledgeable and diverse STEM workforce.

<p><em><strong>Dynamic Pricing with Reference Price Effects</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dissertation mainly focuses on the models and the corresponding dynamic pricing problems that incorporate reference price effects, a concept developed in economics and marketing literature that try to capture the dependency of consumers purchasing behavior on past prices. <br /> <br /> Conceptually, reference price is a price expectation consumers develop from their observations of historical prices. Since it can not be physically observed, various models have been proposed to operationalize its formation. We empirically compare some of the models in the literature and extend the literature by proposing a new reference price model. In addition, we present analysis on the dynamic pricing problems under these models assuming consumers are loss/gain neutral or loss-averse. We find that constant pricing strategies are a robust solution to the problem regardless of which reference price models one may choose.<br /> <br /> Empirical evidences, however, indicate that loss/gain neutral or loss-averse behavior may not be a universal phenomenon. We analyze the dynamic pricing problem when consumers exhibit gain-seeking behavior.

Zhenyu Hu-Final Exam Doctoral Exam Committee: Xin Chen, Chair & Director of Dissertation Research Alexander Olshevsky Nicholas Petruzzi Qiong Wang Dynamic Pricing with Reference Price Effects Abstract This dissertation mainly focuses on the models and the corresponding dynamic pricing problems that incorporate reference price effects, a concept developed in economics and marketing literature that try to capture the dependency of consumers purchasing behavior on past prices. Conceptually, reference price is a price expectation consumers develop from their observations of historical prices. Since it can not be physically observed, various models have been proposed to operationalize its formation. We empirically compare some of the models in the literature and extend the literature by proposing a new reference price model. In addition, we present analysis on the dynamic pricing problems under these models assuming consumers are loss/gain neutral or loss-averse. We find that constant pricing strategies are a robust solution to the problem regardless of which reference price models one may choose. Empirical evidences, however, indicate that loss/gain neutral or loss-averse behavior may not be a universal phenomenon. We analyze the dynamic pricing problem when consumers exhibit gain-seeking behavior. In sharp contrast to the loss-averse case, even myopic pricing strategies can result in complicated cyclic price paths. We show for a special case that a cyclic skimming pricing strategy is optimal and provide conditions to guarantee the optimality of high-low pricing strategies. With the understanding of the qualitative behavior of the optimal pricing strategies under various settings, we develop efficient algorithms to compute the optimal prices in both loss-averse and gain-seeking case. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our algorithms by applying them to a practical problem with real data. Finally, we extend the above considered single-product setting to multi-products setting and analyze the corresponding dynamic pricing problems.

description : <p>The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.</p>

<p>The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year.

<p>A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by</p>

title : KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years

description : <p>Printmaking flourished in Japan during</p>
<p>the Allied Occupation (1945&ndash;52), despite</p>
<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>
<p>promoted the work of contemporary</p>
<p>Japanese printmakers, following the</p>
<p>example of late nineteenth-century</p>
<p>aficionados of ukiyo-e (&ldquo;pictures of</p>
<p>the floating world&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>
<p>diversity. Commercial publishing houses</p>
<p>produced shin hanga (&ldquo;new prints&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>shin hanga adhered to the familiar</p>
<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>
<p>sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s</p>
<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>
<p>manipulations of the print medium,</p>
<p>examples of traditional ukiyo-e and</p>
<p>modern shin hanga are also on display.</p>
<p>The work of foreign print artists who</p>
<p>worked in Japan&mdash;Paul Jacoulet and</p>
<p>Clifton Karhu&mdash;underscores both the</p>
<p>diversity that modern Japanese prints</p>
<p>inspired and the enduring identity of</p>
<p>the woodcut in Japan.</p>

<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>

<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>

description : <p>The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.</p>

title : KAM Exhibition | Speculative Visions of Pragmatic Architectures
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/3694/32720644
description : <p>University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of</p>
<p>the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and</p>
<p>making.</p>
<p>Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these</p>
<p>designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means</p>
<p>for surveying alternative outcomes.</p>
<p>The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.</p>
<p>A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by</p>
<p>Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway</p>
<p>Modernism" documents his process of &ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&rdquo; to</p>
<p>mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several</p>
<p>designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This</p>
<p>exhibition of Hemingway&rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt</p>
<p>to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.</p>

title : KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years

description : <p>Printmaking flourished in Japan during</p>
<p>the Allied Occupation (1945&ndash;52), despite</p>
<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>
<p>promoted the work of contemporary</p>
<p>Japanese printmakers, following the</p>
<p>example of late nineteenth-century</p>
<p>aficionados of ukiyo-e (&ldquo;pictures of</p>
<p>the floating world&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>
<p>diversity. Commercial publishing houses</p>
<p>produced shin hanga (&ldquo;new prints&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>shin hanga adhered to the familiar</p>
<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>

<p><strong>Bio:<br /></strong>Oliver originated from England before moving to Canada at the age of 15 where he went on to complete a PhD in Electrical Engineering at McGill University in Montreal. After university, Oliver joined GE Global Research (GRC) working primarily on R&amp;D for Healthcare. During this time, he was privileged to lead teams that transitioned multiple new electrical system technologies into GE Healthcare&rsquo;s Computer Tomography (CT) machines that impacted performance, simplicity, and cost. These technologies developed and integrated mixed-signal ASICs, advanced electrical packaging, and the controls that convert x-ray&rsquo;s passed through the body into a digital format.</p>
<p>In 2013, after holding positions leading GE&rsquo;s MicroSystem&rsquo;s technology lab and technology portfolios for GE Industrial and Oil &amp; Gas businesses, Oliver became the Technology Leader for the Power Conversion and Delivery organization at GRC. This 80-person team develops technology that converts motion into electricity, converts and distributes electricity across GE systems, and transforms electricity back into motion. Focus areas include: Power Electronics applications that span power from 5 Watts to 20MW, electric machine development that includes harsh environment and high reliability applications, and power systems that optimize grid controls and interactions with a focus on renewables and energy storage. Business applications range from Oil &amp; Gas, Healthcare, Aviation, Industrial Systems, and Energy Systems.</p>
<p>Throughout his career Oliver has been challenged to build teams that develop innovative technologies that can be successfully transitioned and scaled to improve the outcomes for GE customers. This also includes coaching technology teams to adopt Lean Start-up principles within GE.</p>
<p>Outside of GE, Oliver is kept busy with his wife and two children, a 14-year old son, and an 11-year old daughter.

title : The Israel-Palestine E-waste Commodity Chain: Findings and Reflections
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/4024/32718926
description : <p>Over the last several years, Yaakov Garb has worked with a small team to explore and document the informal Palestinian-Israeli entrepreneurial commodity chain through which most Israeli electronic waste has been informally transferred to a cluster of Palestinian villages and dismantled, with valuable materials (primarily copper and motherboards) shipped via Israel to destinations abroad, and the remainder crudely burned and dumped in the rural landscape. Drawing on over a hundred interviews with stakeholders in this commodity chain, extensive field observation, as well as remote sensing imagery and traffic counts, the&nbsp;team has constructed a portrait of this value chain (actors, prices, volumes, and dynamics) and documented its severe environmental and human health consequences. They have&nbsp;also worked with the local Palestinian community to develop a business model, transition strategy, and bargaining power vis-&agrave;-vis the Israeli system to enable allow a shift to cleaner operation while preserving livelihoods.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;talk will describe this e-waste commodity chain, its geopolitical contexts, and the results of our research and advocacy efforts. It will reflect&nbsp;on the broader implications of this case study for thinking about informal commodity chains, their ability to move materials and rework landscapes at large scales, and what we know about them.</p>

<p><strong>Yaakov Garb</strong> is Lecturer at Ben Gurion University and an Adjunct Assistant Professor of International Studies at the Watson Institute, Brown University. He draws on a training in environmental studies and in science and technology studies (STS) in research, teaching, and consulting on environmental and urban issues. Dr. Garb specializes in projects demanding interdisciplinary perspectives, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and a merging of analysis with advocacy for change.&nbsp;</p>

description : <p>This talk will examine the rise of two insurgencies in contemporary Nigeria, on their face of very different character. One - Boko Haram - is a neo-Salafist Islamist movement associated with the northern savanna and draped in the language of Calpihal restoration and True Islam; the other - the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) - a secular movement arising on the oilfields and in the creeks of of the forested Niger delta speaking the language of self determination, resource control and constitutional reform. Drawing upon the ideas of Henri Lefebvre among others, this talk shall&nbsp;attempt to argue for their 'family resemblances' rooted in the relations between petro-capitalism, spatial fragmentation and the exclusion of youth from multiple forms of authority. Each must be grounded too in regionally and culturally specific forms of&nbsp; state-building, warfare and local history which gives to each insurgency a specific coloration and inflection.</p>

<p>This presentation will focus on some non-traditional approaches to prepare PET radiopharmaceuticals for new targets, and aims to show the intricacies of developing PET radiopharmaceuticals from "bench to bedside". Specifically, cutting-edge approaches and technologies for imaging the dopaminergic pathway with PET, as well as our recent work to expand beyond the &ldquo;amyloid cascade hypothesis&rdquo; of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, including tauopathies, will be presented. Several of the neuroimaging agents have also been applied as oncology probes. Translating labeled compounds to PET radiopharmaceuticals and our aspiration to work towards the ultimate, albeit impossible, goal in the field: to radiolabel virtually any compound for PET will be raised as points for discussion.</p>

It is a portrait depicting not an individual but rather an outfit that a clothier can supply. It is also frequently used to describe someone who wears the latest styles. But a plate is also a printing term, describing an illustration transferred to paper during the printing process.</p>
<p>This exhibition explores the interdependence between fashion and print to communicate ideas not only about what people wore, but also about those who produced and experienced these images.&nbsp;The exhibition begins with early modern surveys of national costumes, which sought to codify the diverse cultures that Europeans encountered around the world. It then traces emerging interrelationships among fashion plates and the periodical press, commercialism and the performing arts, and the subsequent evolution of various communities of readers and consumers. It culminates in the emergence of fashion photography, a new medium of expression for fashion in print that still shapes its viewers today.</p>
<p>The exhibition is curated by Anna Chen, Curator of Rare Books and Manuscripts. The exhibition will be on view Monday through Friday, 8:30am to 5pm, in the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>

<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>

<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”).

title : Webinar: Provenance and DataONE: Facilitating Reproducible Science
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/4863/32690983
description : <p>Provenance is a form of metadata that describes the lineage and processing history of data and knowledge artifacts and plays an important role in many scientific applications and use cases. For example, an ecologist might want to combine different datasets for a study, but needs to know how the candidate datasets were derived. A climate scientist might need to document the processing history of climate model outputs to facilitate reproducibility. A natural history collection manager might want to run automated data curation tools on specimen collection data, but has to understand the proposed &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; before executing them. In all these and many other cases like these, provenance information plays a crucial role. In this webinar, we will first give an overview of the different types of provenance information and how they can be used, e.g., to facilitate reproducible science.</p>
<p>We will show how a DataONE user can search and navigate provenance information using the new UI currently under development in DataONE. After this user-oriented view on provenance, we finally take a look &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; of the DataONE provenance technologies and present plans for future developments.</p>

description : <p>Printmaking flourished in Japan during</p>
<p>the Allied Occupation (1945&ndash;52), despite</p>
<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>
<p>promoted the work of contemporary</p>
<p>Japanese printmakers, following the</p>
<p>example of late nineteenth-century</p>
<p>aficionados of ukiyo-e (&ldquo;pictures of</p>
<p>the floating world&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>
<p>diversity. Commercial publishing houses</p>
<p>produced shin hanga (&ldquo;new prints&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>shin hanga adhered to the familiar</p>
<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>
<p>sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s</p>
<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>
<p>manipulations of the print medium,</p>
<p>examples of traditional ukiyo-e and</p>
<p>modern shin hanga are also on display.</p>
<p>The work of foreign print artists who</p>
<p>worked in Japan&mdash;Paul Jacoulet and</p>
<p>Clifton Karhu&mdash;underscores both the</p>
<p>diversity that modern Japanese prints</p>
<p>inspired and the enduring identity of</p>
<p>the woodcut in Japan.</p>

Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

Professor Harding and the Illinois Bands During WWI, As war enveloped much of Western Europe in 1914 and 1915 our country struggled to justify its involvement in this conflict and our national leaders overwhelmingly favored peaceful negotiation as the only logical way to end Europe’s war.  However by 1916 Germany’s military had devastated large portions of Belgium and France, and presented a serious threat to Great Britain as well as commercial shipping across the north Atlantic.  While fear of a German invasion spawned discussions on the possible need to close the University of Illinois or at least discontinue courses that did not provide relevant training to support a military build-up if needed, the University’s band program under the direction of A. Austin Harding continued to provide the campus and the local community with musical artistry, patriotic fervor, and moral support during the darkest days of WWI.  This exhibit investigates the challenges that Harding faced as many of his band’s members enlisted in the army and navy in 1917 after America entered the war, and highlights the role that Harding and his bands played to support that nation’s war effort.

Many Voices: The Great War in America’s Songs, When World War I began in 1914 the United States proclaimed that it would follow a policy of strict neutrality “in thought and deed,” and President Wilson firmly believed that peace was the only course of action needed to resolve the European conflict.  Many Americans felt the same way, but as the war’s atrocities, both fictional and real, were publicized, some politicians and military leaders began to voice their support for military intervention.  After the United States declared war against Germany on April 6, 1917 the country witnessed a dramatic mobilization of industry and financial resources to produce trained soldiers, food, munitions, and equipment which were in short supply at the start of America’s involvement.  The federal government set up hundreds of temporary agencies with over a million new employees to help redirect the nation’s economy.  America’s sheet music industry joined forces with the U.S. Committee on Public Information to help sell the ideals of patriotism, sacrifice, and volunteerism to the American public as the only way to win this war.  This special exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History depicts the diverse portrayals of soldiers’ lives, recruitment of African-American soldiers, women’s support for the war effort, and the country’s financial and personal sacrifice through the melodies, lyrics and graphic illustrations of sheet music that were produced between 1917 and 1919.

<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>

<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>

2015 Ralph and Ruth Fisher Forum: Violence in Twenthieth-Century Russia and Eurasia: Experience, Affect, Memory, and Legacies VIOLENCE IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY RUSSIA AND EURASIA: EXPERIENCE, AFFECT, MEMORY, AND LEGACIES June 19-20, 2015 Russian, East European, and Eurasian Center University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Organized by Harriet Murav and Mark Steinberg In a poem dedicated to the memory of 19 June 1914, Anna Akhmatova wrote "we aged a hundred years and this / Happened in a single hour." The twentieth century brought unprecedented violence to the European world, not least in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. The years 1914-1921, among the most bloody and destructive in Russia's history, cannot be understood in isolation from the whole jagged landscape of violence - international wars, violent political force, national and revolutionary violence, ethnic and racial violence, interpersonal and domestic violence. Boundaries do not easily stand in violent conditions. Emancipatory and repressive violence mix and blur. Purposeful political and social struggles mix with "hooliganism" and commonplace human brutality. And violence itself is only part of the story. The twentieth century, especially its first decades, saw a remarkable explosion of creativity in the arts, literature, science, politics, philosophy, and social organization, as well as extraordinary technological innovation and invention. Indeed, violence itself could be understood in radically different ways, including as creativity, even as actions in the name of life. The 2015 Fisher Forum will examine the immediacy, effects, and refractions of violence in Russia and Eurasia (defined as the spaces occupied by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union) from perspective across disciplines. Papers will also engage the question of how to interpret and theorize violence, as practice, as experience, as legacy.

title : Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Evolution of Soviet Empire
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/598/32706929
description : <p>Following the history of Georgians beyond the Georgian republic from 1917 to the present, this presentation explores the rise and fall of the Soviet multiethnic empire from the perspective of its most prominent internal diaspora. Joseph Stalin (Jughashvili) was just one of a group of Georgian revolutionaries who came to power in the early years of Soviet rule and directed the development of the new state. After the socialist state was established, Soviet citizens sought new opportunities for leisure and consumption and found them at the Georgian restaurant, where they adopted the distinctive rituals of the Georgian table. During Khrushchev&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thaw,&rdquo; Georgian cultural entrepreneurs embodied the era&rsquo;s spirit of spontaneity as popular ethnic entertainers specializing in song, dance, and theater. As official life grew stagnant under Brezhnev, Georgians thrived in the burgeoning informal economy. Finally, with the advent of Gorbachev&rsquo;s reforms, it was a Georgian film, <em>Repentance</em>, that explored the furthest limits of allowable expression, calling into question the very legitimacy of Soviet power. The prominence of the Georgian diaspora suggests that the Soviet Union was not simply a Russian empire, nor merely a multiethnic state composed of separate nations; instead, it was an empire of diasporas, where politics, culture, and economics were constituted by the mixing of a diverse array of mobile nationalities.</p>
<p><strong>Erik R. Scott</strong> is Assistant Professor of Russian and Soviet history at the University of Kansas. Drawing on years of fieldwork and knowledge of several regional languages, his research and teaching explore migration and diaspora within and beyond the imperial borders of Russia and Eurasia. His book, <em>Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Multiethnic Soviet Empire </em>(forthcoming from Oxford University Press in 2016), reimagines the Soviet empire by revealing how external borders concealed an array of specialized internal diaspora populations. He has recently begun a new project on Soviet defectors and the production of Cold War borders, focusing in particular on the winding journeys of defectors through border zones, transit hubs, extraterritorial spaces, and contested areas beyond the limits of state jurisdiction. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on Russian and Soviet history, the Cold War, comparative empires, and migration in global perspective. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2011 and was the Post-Doctoral Fellow in Caucasian and Central Asian Affairs at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies from 2011 to 2012.</p>

<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>
<p>sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s</p>
<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>

By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan. Guest Curator:  Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies   This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association).

title : KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/62/32667260
description : <p>Printmaking flourished in Japan during</p>
<p>the Allied Occupation (1945&ndash;52), despite</p>
<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>
<p>promoted the work of contemporary</p>
<p>Japanese printmakers, following the</p>
<p>example of late nineteenth-century</p>
<p>aficionados of ukiyo-e (&ldquo;pictures of</p>
<p>the floating world&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>
<p>diversity. Commercial publishing houses</p>
<p>produced shin hanga (&ldquo;new prints&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>shin hanga adhered to the familiar</p>
<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>
<p>sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s</p>
<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>
<p>manipulations of the print medium,</p>
<p>examples of traditional ukiyo-e and</p>
<p>modern shin hanga are also on display.</p>
<p>The work of foreign print artists who</p>
<p>worked in Japan&mdash;Paul Jacoulet and</p>
<p>Clifton Karhu&mdash;underscores both the</p>
<p>diversity that modern Japanese prints</p>
<p>inspired and the enduring identity of</p>
<p>the woodcut in Japan.</p>

title : Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Evolution of Soviet Empire
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/698/32706929
description : <p>Following the history of Georgians beyond the Georgian republic from 1917 to the present, this presentation explores the rise and fall of the Soviet multiethnic empire from the perspective of its most prominent internal diaspora. Joseph Stalin (Jughashvili) was just one of a group of Georgian revolutionaries who came to power in the early years of Soviet rule and directed the development of the new state. After the socialist state was established, Soviet citizens sought new opportunities for leisure and consumption and found them at the Georgian restaurant, where they adopted the distinctive rituals of the Georgian table. During Khrushchev&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thaw,&rdquo; Georgian cultural entrepreneurs embodied the era&rsquo;s spirit of spontaneity as popular ethnic entertainers specializing in song, dance, and theater. As official life grew stagnant under Brezhnev, Georgians thrived in the burgeoning informal economy. Finally, with the advent of Gorbachev&rsquo;s reforms, it was a Georgian film, <em>Repentance</em>, that explored the furthest limits of allowable expression, calling into question the very legitimacy of Soviet power. The prominence of the Georgian diaspora suggests that the Soviet Union was not simply a Russian empire, nor merely a multiethnic state composed of separate nations; instead, it was an empire of diasporas, where politics, culture, and economics were constituted by the mixing of a diverse array of mobile nationalities.</p>
<p><strong>Erik R. Scott</strong> is Assistant Professor of Russian and Soviet history at the University of Kansas. Drawing on years of fieldwork and knowledge of several regional languages, his research and teaching explore migration and diaspora within and beyond the imperial borders of Russia and Eurasia. His book, <em>Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Multiethnic Soviet Empire </em>(forthcoming from Oxford University Press in 2016), reimagines the Soviet empire by revealing how external borders concealed an array of specialized internal diaspora populations. He has recently begun a new project on Soviet defectors and the production of Cold War borders, focusing in particular on the winding journeys of defectors through border zones, transit hubs, extraterritorial spaces, and contested areas beyond the limits of state jurisdiction. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on Russian and Soviet history, the Cold War, comparative empires, and migration in global perspective. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2011 and was the Post-Doctoral Fellow in Caucasian and Central Asian Affairs at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies from 2011 to 2012.</p>

title : Webinar: Provenance and DataONE: Facilitating Reproducible Science
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/772/32690983
description : <p>Provenance is a form of metadata that describes the lineage and processing history of data and knowledge artifacts and plays an important role in many scientific applications and use cases. For example, an ecologist might want to combine different datasets for a study, but needs to know how the candidate datasets were derived. A climate scientist might need to document the processing history of climate model outputs to facilitate reproducibility. A natural history collection manager might want to run automated data curation tools on specimen collection data, but has to understand the proposed &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; before executing them. In all these and many other cases like these, provenance information plays a crucial role. In this webinar, we will first give an overview of the different types of provenance information and how they can be used, e.g., to facilitate reproducible science.</p>
<p>We will show how a DataONE user can search and navigate provenance information using the new UI currently under development in DataONE. After this user-oriented view on provenance, we finally take a look &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; of the DataONE provenance technologies and present plans for future developments.</p>

Big Data Hub Informational Meeting The National Science Foundation is launching a 10-year effort to create partnerships around big data and the management infrastructure for big data. The partnerships and infrastructure are expected to evolve around four regions (South, Northeast, Midwest and West), and NSF is calling for the creation of four Regional Innovation Big Data Hubs. Phase 1 of this effort began with a solicitation in which NSF expects to fund up to four proposals (one from each region). Illinois is directing the effort for the Midwest Regional Big Data Innovation Hub. NCSA director Ed Seidel and Klara Nahrstedt, director of the Coordinated Science Laboratory, are leading this effort. The Midwest proposal is being written in collaboration with many organizations covering the broad big data challenges of the Midwest, which then academia, industry, foundations, and non-profit organizations can assist to solve.

description : <p>When you offer a course, you are essentially promising your students that if they come to class, work hard, and fulfill all of the requirements you set out for them, then they will learn something valuable. It is therefore essential to make sure your course fulfills that promise.</p>
<p>In this hour, you will be introduced to a method of course design that will help ensure proper alignment of course objectives, assessments, activities, and policies in such a way that students are likely to learn and succeed. You will also be introduced to the knowledge dimension of Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy, which will assist you in determining the kinds of learning you want your students to achieve.</p>

<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

description : <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The landscape of cyberinfrastructure for research is rapidly changing. There is a move towards virtualized and programmable infrastructure. The cloud paradigm enables applications to use computing resources at different places and optimize workflows in either bringing computing to the data or the other way around. Programmable networks allow networks to be utilized in unprecedented ways to create application specific Internets. This talk presents the latest developments in the Research and Education Networks to support Big Data sciences.</p>

description : <p><span class="comment-text "><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.</span></span></p>

During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan. Guest Curator:  Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies   This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking

The exhibit will be on display Tuesday, February 17–Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association).

Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s.

Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association).

Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students. A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway Modernism" documents his process of “Modernism as Preservation” to mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This exhibition of Hemingway’s design and preservation work will attempt to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.   Guest Curator: Jeffery S.

The twentieth century brought unprecedented violence to the European world, not least in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. The years 1914-1921, among the most bloody and destructive in Russia's history, cannot be understood in isolation from the whole jagged landscape of violence - international wars, violent political force, national and revolutionary violence, ethnic and racial violence, interpersonal and domestic violence. Boundaries do not easily stand in violent conditions. Emancipatory and repressive violence mix and blur. Purposeful political and social struggles mix with "hooliganism" and commonplace human brutality. And violence itself is only part of the story. The twentieth century, especially its first decades, saw a remarkable explosion of creativity in the arts, literature, science, politics, philosophy, and social organization, as well as extraordinary technological innovation and invention. Indeed, violence itself could be understood in radically different ways, including as creativity, even as actions in the name of life. The 2015 Fisher Forum will examine the immediacy, effects, and refractions of violence in Russia and Eurasia (defined as the spaces occupied by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union) from perspective across disciplines. Papers will also engage the question of how to interpret and theorize violence, as practice, as experience, as legacy.

KAM Exhibition | Versions and Revisions Meant as a complement to both "MetaModern" and "Artists Including Me: William Wegman", this exhibition displays works from the permanent collection that directly reference canonical works of art, specific artists, and art historical styles. Some artists convey a sense of adoration for their subject—playfully or with great reverence—while others use their works to critique society, religion, or even the art historical canon. While focusing on works from the 1960s through the early 2000s, the exhibition highlights artists such as Vija Celmins, Salvador Dalí, Marlene Dumas, Yves Klein, Richard Pettibone, Mel Ramos, Karl Wirsum, and Huang Yan.   Curator: Kathryn Koca Polite

By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan. Guest Curator:  Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies   This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association).

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display.

<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>

<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>

The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students. A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway Modernism" documents his process of “Modernism as Preservation” to mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This exhibition of Hemingway’s design and preservation work will attempt to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.   Guest Curator: Jeffery S.

<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>

<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>

<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>

title : Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Evolution of Soviet Empire
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/852/32706929
description : <p>Following the history of Georgians beyond the Georgian republic from 1917 to the present, this presentation explores the rise and fall of the Soviet multiethnic empire from the perspective of its most prominent internal diaspora. Joseph Stalin (Jughashvili) was just one of a group of Georgian revolutionaries who came to power in the early years of Soviet rule and directed the development of the new state. After the socialist state was established, Soviet citizens sought new opportunities for leisure and consumption and found them at the Georgian restaurant, where they adopted the distinctive rituals of the Georgian table. During Khrushchev&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thaw,&rdquo; Georgian cultural entrepreneurs embodied the era&rsquo;s spirit of spontaneity as popular ethnic entertainers specializing in song, dance, and theater. As official life grew stagnant under Brezhnev, Georgians thrived in the burgeoning informal economy. Finally, with the advent of Gorbachev&rsquo;s reforms, it was a Georgian film, <em>Repentance</em>, that explored the furthest limits of allowable expression, calling into question the very legitimacy of Soviet power. The prominence of the Georgian diaspora suggests that the Soviet Union was not simply a Russian empire, nor merely a multiethnic state composed of separate nations; instead, it was an empire of diasporas, where politics, culture, and economics were constituted by the mixing of a diverse array of mobile nationalities.</p>
<p><strong>Erik R. Scott</strong> is Assistant Professor of Russian and Soviet history at the University of Kansas. Drawing on years of fieldwork and knowledge of several regional languages, his research and teaching explore migration and diaspora within and beyond the imperial borders of Russia and Eurasia. His book, <em>Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Multiethnic Soviet Empire </em>(forthcoming from Oxford University Press in 2016), reimagines the Soviet empire by revealing how external borders concealed an array of specialized internal diaspora populations. He has recently begun a new project on Soviet defectors and the production of Cold War borders, focusing in particular on the winding journeys of defectors through border zones, transit hubs, extraterritorial spaces, and contested areas beyond the limits of state jurisdiction. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on Russian and Soviet history, the Cold War, comparative empires, and migration in global perspective. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2011 and was the Post-Doctoral Fellow in Caucasian and Central Asian Affairs at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies from 2011 to 2012.</p>

description : <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />TBA</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Karla Mallette studies communications between literary traditions in the medieval Mediterranean&mdash;especially Arabic and the Romance vernaculars&mdash;and the way that we remember that history today. Her first book, <em>The Kingdom of Sicily, 1100-1250: A Literary History</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), traced the transition between Arabic and Italian literary traditions in medieval Sicily; her second, <em>European Modernity and the Arab Mediterranean</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), focused on a southern European tradition of scholarship that identifies the origins of modernity in the contact between Islamic and Christian civilizations in the medieval Mediterranean. Her current project, tentatively titled&nbsp;<em>Lives of the Great Languages: Cosmopolitan Languages in the Medieval Mediterranean</em>, studies the strategies that language uses to transcend the boundaries that language creates. By profiling two pre-modern cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and Latin, and acknowledging the emergent cosmopolitan languages of the twenty-first century, the book contextualizes and defamiliarizes the national language system of European modernity. She has published essays on medieval translations of Aristotelian philosophy, framed narratives, European Orientalism, and Mediterranean Studies, in addition to Italian literature.</p>

<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>

<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>

<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>

<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>
<p>sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s</p>
<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>
<p>manipulations of the print medium,</p>
<p>examples of traditional ukiyo-e and</p>
<p>modern shin hanga are also on display.</p>
<p>The work of foreign print artists who</p>
<p>worked in Japan&mdash;Paul Jacoulet and</p>

KAM Exhibition | Speculative Visions of Pragmatic Architectures University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and making. Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means for surveying alternative outcomes. The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students. A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture.

description : <p>Printmaking flourished in Japan during</p>
<p>the Allied Occupation (1945&ndash;52), despite</p>
<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>
<p>promoted the work of contemporary</p>
<p>Japanese printmakers, following the</p>
<p>example of late nineteenth-century</p>
<p>aficionados of ukiyo-e (&ldquo;pictures of</p>
<p>the floating world&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>
<p>diversity. Commercial publishing houses</p>
<p>produced shin hanga (&ldquo;new prints&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>shin hanga adhered to the familiar</p>
<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>
<p>sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s</p>
<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>
<p>manipulations of the print medium,</p>
<p>examples of traditional ukiyo-e and</p>
<p>modern shin hanga are also on display.</p>
<p>The work of foreign print artists who</p>
<p>worked in Japan&mdash;Paul Jacoulet and</p>
<p>Clifton Karhu&mdash;underscores both the</p>

By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan. Guest Curator:  Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies   This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking

KAM Exhibition | Speculative Visions of Pragmatic Architectures University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and making. Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means for surveying alternative outcomes. The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students. A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway Modernism" documents his process of “Modernism as Preservation” to mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This exhibition of Hemingway’s design and preservation work will attempt to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.   Guest Curator: Jeffery S.

description : <p>Printmaking flourished in Japan during</p>
<p>the Allied Occupation (1945&ndash;52), despite</p>
<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>
<p>promoted the work of contemporary</p>
<p>Japanese printmakers, following the</p>
<p>example of late nineteenth-century</p>
<p>aficionados of ukiyo-e (&ldquo;pictures of</p>
<p>the floating world&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>
<p>diversity. Commercial publishing houses</p>
<p>produced shin hanga (&ldquo;new prints&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>shin hanga adhered to the familiar</p>
<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibition features the work of</p>
<p>sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s</p>
<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>
<p>manipulations of the print medium,</p>
<p>examples of traditional ukiyo-e and</p>
<p>modern shin hanga are also on display.</p>
<p>The work of foreign print artists who</p>
<p>worked in Japan&mdash;Paul Jacoulet and</p>
<p>Clifton Karhu&mdash;underscores both the</p>
<p>diversity that modern Japanese prints</p>
<p>inspired and the enduring identity of</p>

<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>

<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>

<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>

<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>

"Erik Hemingway Modernism" documents his process of “Modernism as Preservation” to mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This exhibition of Hemingway’s design and preservation work will attempt to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.   Guest Curator: Jeffery S.

KAM Exhibition | Speculative Visions of Pragmatic Architectures University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and making. Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means for surveying alternative outcomes. The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students. A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway Modernism" documents his process of “Modernism as Preservation” to mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This exhibition of Hemingway’s design and preservation work will attempt to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.   Guest Curator: Jeffery S.

<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>

<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>

During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan. Guest Curator:  Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies   This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”).

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war.

KAM Exhibition | Speculative Visions of Pragmatic Architectures University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and making. Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means for surveying alternative outcomes. The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students. A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway Modernism" documents his process of “Modernism as Preservation” to mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This exhibition of Hemingway’s design and preservation work will attempt to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.   Guest Curator: Jeffery S.

Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.</span></span></p>

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s. To clarify their singular manipulations of the print medium, examples of traditional ukiyo-e and modern shin hanga are also on display. The work of foreign print artists who worked in Japan—Paul Jacoulet and Clifton Karhu—underscores both the diversity that modern Japanese prints inspired and the enduring identity of the woodcut in Japan.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association). Koshiro and his followers later experimented with nearly every aspect of woodblock printing, while adhering to the basic tenet that woodcuts be carved and printed by their makers. Hence, their work is called sosaku hanga, literally “prints made by their creator,” although this term is ordinarily translated as “creative prints.” This exhibition features the work of sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s and 1960s.

KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years Printmaking flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–52), despite the devastation of the war. Woodblock prints—together with dolls, fans, silks, and sake cups—were sought after as souvenirs among the nearly half million American soldiers stationed in Occupied Japan. During the Cold War that followed, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe actively promoted the work of contemporary Japanese printmakers, following the example of late nineteenth-century aficionados of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock prints presented collectors with striking diversity. Commercial publishing houses produced shin hanga (“new prints”). Popular during the 1920s and 1930s, shin hanga adhered to the familiar idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi Koshiro (1891–1955) and members of his print society emulated the pioneering work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882–1946), who made “knife pictures” on his own without the support of a publisher, and who in 1918 helped to establish the Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan Creative Print Association).

description : <p>Printmaking flourished in Japan during</p>
<p>the Allied Occupation (1945&ndash;52), despite</p>
<p>the devastation of the war. Woodblock</p>
<p>prints&mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,</p>
<p>and sake cups&mdash;were sought after as</p>
<p>souvenirs among the nearly half million</p>
<p>American soldiers stationed in Occupied</p>
<p>Japan. During the Cold War that</p>
<p>followed, museums and collectors in</p>
<p>the United States and Europe actively</p>
<p>promoted the work of contemporary</p>
<p>Japanese printmakers, following the</p>
<p>example of late nineteenth-century</p>
<p>aficionados of ukiyo-e (&ldquo;pictures of</p>
<p>the floating world&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock</p>
<p>prints presented collectors with striking</p>
<p>diversity. Commercial publishing houses</p>
<p>produced shin hanga (&ldquo;new prints&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>shin hanga adhered to the familiar</p>
<p>idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi</p>
<p>Koshiro (1891&ndash;1955) and members of</p>
<p>his print society emulated the pioneering</p>
<p>work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&ndash;1946),</p>
<p>who made &ldquo;knife pictures&rdquo; on his own</p>
<p>without the support of a publisher, and</p>
<p>who in 1918 helped to establish the</p>
<p>Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan</p>
<p>Creative Print Association). Koshiro and</p>
<p>his followers later experimented with</p>
<p>nearly every aspect of woodblock</p>
<p>printing, while adhering to the basic tenet</p>
<p>that woodcuts be carved and printed by</p>
<p>their makers. Hence, their work is called</p>
<p>sosaku hanga, literally &ldquo;prints made by</p>
<p>their creator,&rdquo; although this term is</p>
<p>ordinarily translated as &ldquo;creative prints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>and 1960s. To clarify their singular</p>

title : International Sociological Association RC-43: Housing and the Built Environment Conference
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/878/32465124
description : <p>This conference is hosted by the Housing and Built Environment Research Committee of the International Sociological Association (RC43).<br /> <br /> <strong>The Theme</strong></p>
<p>Growing economic inequality and socio-spatial polarization challenge both developed and developing countries. Housing policy stands at a crossroads--will our housing systems widen or close the gap between those with means and those without? Will residential neighborhoods serve as social and economic melting pots, or will they harden the boundaries reflective of the growing wealth and power of elite social groups? What should be done and what can be done are very different questions.</p>
<p>Can housing markets and policies better serve as one of the important factors promoting social outcomes in which all have fairer access to the opportunities and benefits that cities and neighborhoods provide?</p>
<p><strong>The Call &nbsp;</strong><br /> <br /> The RC43 encourages cross-disciplinary debate and welcomes housing research papers from all social science disciplines. We invite both panel session proposals and individual abstracts related to the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing markets, structural crises, and socio-spatial outcomes</li>
<li>The role of housing policy in socio-spatial inequality</li>
<li>Comparative contexts: housing system diversity and/or convergence</li>
<li>Housing and social theory in a globalized, neoliberal era</li>
<li>Social/public housing strategies</li>
<li>The changing role of the private rented sector</li>
<li>Neighborhood socio-spatial change</li>
<li>Housing through the lifecourse</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers should be 5,000 to 8,000 words inclusive. Sessions are two hours long, and can have up to five papers. Individual presentations should be 15 minutes long.<br /> <br /> The deadline for abstracts is March 15, 2015. Abstracts should be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:isa.rc43@gmail.com">isa.rc43@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>There will be a pre-conference for PhD students on September 16, 2015. More information on this day will be coming soon; please check the website for updates.</p>

2015 Ralph and Ruth Fisher Forum: Violence in Twenthieth-Century Russia and Eurasia: Experience, Affect, Memory, and Legacies VIOLENCE IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY RUSSIA AND EURASIA: EXPERIENCE, AFFECT, MEMORY, AND LEGACIES June 19-20, 2015 Russian, East European, and Eurasian Center University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Organized by Harriet Murav and Mark Steinberg In a poem dedicated to the memory of 19 June 1914, Anna Akhmatova wrote "we aged a hundred years and this / Happened in a single hour." The twentieth century brought unprecedented violence to the European world, not least in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. The years 1914-1921, among the most bloody and destructive in Russia's history, cannot be understood in isolation from the whole jagged landscape of violence - international wars, violent political force, national and revolutionary violence, ethnic and racial violence, interpersonal and domestic violence. Boundaries do not easily stand in violent conditions. Emancipatory and repressive violence mix and blur. Purposeful political and social struggles mix with "hooliganism" and commonplace human brutality. And violence itself is only part of the story. The twentieth century, especially its first decades, saw a remarkable explosion of creativity in the arts, literature, science, politics, philosophy, and social organization, as well as extraordinary technological innovation and invention. Indeed, violence itself could be understood in radically different ways, including as creativity, even as actions in the name of life. The 2015 Fisher Forum will examine the immediacy, effects, and refractions of violence in Russia and Eurasia (defined as the spaces occupied by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union) from perspective across disciplines. Papers will also engage the question of how to interpret and theorize violence, as practice, as experience, as legacy.

First Day of Instruction, Summer Term 2
title : UIUC - MGH Seminar Series-Neil Vasdev, PhD, Massachusetts General Hospital
link : http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/990/32706485
description : <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Cutting-edge radiochemical methods and technologies for human PET imaging"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Neil Vasdev, Ph.D.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Director of Radiochemistry, Massachusetts General Hospital</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Associate Professor, Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>This presentation will focus on some non-traditional approaches to prepare PET radiopharmaceuticals for new targets, and aims to show the intricacies of developing PET radiopharmaceuticals from "bench to bedside". Specifically, cutting-edge approaches and technologies for imaging the dopaminergic pathway with PET, as well as our recent work to expand beyond the &ldquo;amyloid cascade hypothesis&rdquo; of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, including tauopathies, will be presented. Several of the neuroimaging agents have also been applied as oncology probes. Translating labeled compounds to PET radiopharmaceuticals and our aspiration to work towards the ultimate, albeit impossible, goal in the field: to radiolabel virtually any compound for PET will be raised as points for discussion.</p>
