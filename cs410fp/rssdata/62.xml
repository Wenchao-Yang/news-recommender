            <description>&lt;p&gt;Pogo Studio was established in downtown Champaign, IL, in 1985 and quickly earned local, regional and national recognition for its finely crafted recordings and its owner&amp;rsquo;s easy-going nature. &amp;nbsp;The studio remained a fixture of the community&amp;rsquo;s music scene and a valuable resource for regional recording artists for nearly thirty years. &amp;nbsp;During the early 1980s its founder, Mark Rubel, developed his audio engineering and production expertise while working at the University of Illinois&amp;rsquo; Experimental Music Studios and the Faithful Sound recording studio which was located in Urbana, IL. &amp;nbsp;As an active performing bass guitarist, an employee of the talent agency, Blytham Ltd., and project chair for the Champaign County Arts Council, Rubel developed a robust professional relationship with a variety of musicians and bands throughout central Illinois. &amp;nbsp;As a result Pogo Studio recorded and produced over one thousand different projects with such musicians as Adrian Belew and Alison Krauss; rock bands Hum, Menthol, Starcastle and the Vertebrats; &amp;nbsp;community music groups like Amasong; and a variety of performances by student ensembles and faculty from the University of Illinois, Eastern Illinois University and Parkland Community College. &amp;nbsp; This exhibition showcases the unique music legacy of Mark Rubel and Pogo Studio through photographs, oral histories, and sound recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;As war enveloped much of Western Europe in 1914 and 1915 our country struggled to justify its involvement in this conflict and our national leaders overwhelmingly favored peaceful negotiation as the only logical way to end Europe&amp;rsquo;s war. &amp;nbsp;However by 1916 Germany&amp;rsquo;s military had devastated large portions of Belgium and France, and presented a serious threat to Great Britain as well as commercial shipping across the north Atlantic. &amp;nbsp;While fear of a German invasion spawned discussions on the possible need to close the University of Illinois or at least discontinue courses that did not provide relevant training to support a military build-up if needed, the University&amp;rsquo;s band program under the direction of A. Austin Harding continued to provide the campus and the local community with musical artistry, patriotic fervor, and moral support during the darkest days of WWI. &amp;nbsp;This exhibit investigates the challenges that Harding faced as many of his band&amp;rsquo;s members enlisted in the army and navy in 1917 after America entered the war, and highlights the role that Harding and his bands played to support that nation&amp;rsquo;s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;When World War I began in 1914 the United States proclaimed that it would follow a policy of strict neutrality &amp;ldquo;in thought and deed,&amp;rdquo; and President Wilson firmly believed that peace was the only course of action needed to resolve the European conflict. &amp;nbsp;Many Americans felt the same way, but as the war&amp;rsquo;s atrocities, both fictional and real, were publicized, some politicians and military leaders began to voice their support for military intervention. &amp;nbsp;After the United States declared war against Germany on April 6, 1917 the country witnessed a dramatic mobilization of industry and financial resources to produce trained soldiers, food, munitions, and equipment which were in short supply at the start of America&amp;rsquo;s involvement. &amp;nbsp;The federal government set up hundreds of temporary agencies with over a million new employees to help redirect the nation&amp;rsquo;s economy. &amp;nbsp;America&amp;rsquo;s sheet music industry joined forces with the U.S. Committee on Public Information to help sell the ideals of patriotism, sacrifice, and volunteerism to the American public as the only way to win this war. &amp;nbsp;This special exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution&amp;rsquo;s National Museum of American History depicts the diverse portrayals of soldiers&amp;rsquo; lives, recruitment of African-American soldiers, women&amp;rsquo;s support for the war effort, and the country&amp;rsquo;s financial and personal sacrifice through the melodies, lyrics and graphic illustrations of sheet music that were produced between 1917 and 1919.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;For over a century, the University of Illinois has played a leading role in the promotion of educational exchange with China. UI President Edmund James was a leader in the movement to open US universities to Chinese students in 1906, when US policy toward China was very restrictive in this area. This exhibit tells the story of how James&amp;#8217;s vision led the University of Illinois to become one of the most significant destinations for Chinese students during the early decades of the 20th century. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Meant as a complement to both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MetaModern" and "Artists Including Me: William Wegman",&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this exhibition displays works from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the permanent collection that directly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reference canonical works of art,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specific artists, and art historical styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some artists convey a sense of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adoration for their subject&amp;mdash;playfully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or with great reverence&amp;mdash;while others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use their works to critique society,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;religion, or even the art historical canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While focusing on works from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1960s through the early 2000s, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition highlights artists such as Vija&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celmins, Salvador Dal&amp;iacute;, Marlene Dumas,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves Klein, Richard Pettibone, Mel&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: Jeffery S. Poss, FAIA&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Meant as a complement to both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MetaModern" and "Artists Including Me: William Wegman",&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this exhibition displays works from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the permanent collection that directly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reference canonical works of art,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specific artists, and art historical styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some artists convey a sense of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adoration for their subject&amp;mdash;playfully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or with great reverence&amp;mdash;while others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use their works to critique society,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;religion, or even the art historical canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While focusing on works from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1960s through the early 2000s, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition highlights artists such as Vija&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celmins, Salvador Dal&amp;iacute;, Marlene Dumas,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves Klein, Richard Pettibone, Mel&lt;/p&gt;
