MSW is a public awareness campaign designed to help consumers better manage their personal finances. Hundreds of organizations across the state and Midwest come together once a year to stress the importance of financial literacy, inform consumers where they can get help, and provide free educational seminars and activities throughout the week. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus partners provide programming about all facets of personal finance from establishing a budget and saving, to building a credit score and negotiating a salary.  Money Smart Week is April 2-9, 2011.</description>
