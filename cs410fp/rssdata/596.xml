            <description>&lt;p&gt;For over a century, the University of Illinois has played a leading role in the promotion of educational exchange with China. UI President Edmund James was a leader in the movement to open US universities to Chinese students in 1906, when US policy toward China was very restrictive in this area. This exhibit tells the story of how James&amp;#8217;s vision led the University of Illinois to become one of the most significant destinations for Chinese students during the early decades of the 20th century. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Opening Reception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, May 9 &amp;middot; 5&amp;ndash;7 pm&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Opening Reception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, May 9 &amp;middot; 5&amp;ndash;7 pm&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: Jeffery S. Poss, FAIA&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>KAM Exhibition | With the Grain: Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Postwar Years</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an important part of the Chinese culture. Acupuncture, as an important part of TCM, and an effective, safe, and widely applicable natural treatment, has been accepted by more than 160 countries. This lecture introduces some basic theories and ideas behind TCM, including the flow of Qi (Chi) and blood in the channel system of the human body, how illness is explained by the interruptions of the body's points and channels, and how acupuncture is thought to provide effective treatments to certain illnesses by regulating and stimulating the flow of Qi in the channel system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
