        <description>The mission of the Illini Biotechnology Organization is to bridge the gap between academia and the biotechnology industry. We aim to provide students, faculty, and other university affiliates the resources and professional development opportunities to fulfill this mission.

Our current goals include forming alliances with other biotechnology clubs and organizations in the Midwest area.  We have already connected with iBIO and the iBIO Institute to develop initiatives, which promote the growth of biotechnology in Illinois.</description>
