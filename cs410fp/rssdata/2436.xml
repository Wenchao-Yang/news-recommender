&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hactivists. Nation states. Organized crime. Is your company's information safe? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Joe Dubbs, a director in PwC's financial services cyber security consulting practice, will provide a current perspective on these threats - and others - that organizations face. We'll review the methods that attackers use, as well as the questions that you need to be asking to control the risk of cyber threats. It's the last Roundtable of the 2014 - 15 series, so make your reservation today!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Lunch and CPE credit provided.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;RSVP by Tuesday, May 12th, 2015.&lt;/div&gt;
