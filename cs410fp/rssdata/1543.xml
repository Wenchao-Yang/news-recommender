            <description>&lt;p&gt;The Office of Technology Management (OTM) at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign manages intellectual property resulting from the research activities at the univesity. We work with units across campus to help identify, protect, license or otherwise promote research &amp;nbsp;innovations for public use. Svetlana Sowers&amp;nbsp; from OTM and a representative from University Counsel will present a brief overview of OTM services, will discuss how our office can serve NCSA )including promoting and disseminating works developed at NCSA), and will be there to answer your questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;The landscape of cyberinfrastructure for research is rapidly changing. There is a move towards virtualized and programmable infrastructure. The cloud paradigm enables applications to use computing resources at different places and optimize workflows in either bringing computing to the data or the other way around. Programmable networks allow networks to be utilized in unprecedented ways to create application specific Internets. This talk presents the latest developments in the Research and Education Networks to support Big Data sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Professor de Laat chairs the System and Network Engineering (SNE) laboratory in the Informatics Institute of the Faculty of Science at University of Amsterdam. Research in his group ranges from optical and switched networking and workflows for processing of big data in PetaScale e-Science applications, Semantic Web to describe e-infrastructure resources, information complexity, Authorization architectures and Systems Security &amp;amp; privacy of information in distributed environments. Prof. de Laat serves on the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Policy Board on matters regarding ESnet, is co-founder of the Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF), founder of GRIDforum.nl and founding member of CineGrid.org. His group is/was part of EU projects SWITCH, CYCLONE, ENVRIplus and ENVRI, EuroBrazil, Geysers, NOVI, NEXTGRID, EGEE, and others. He is a member of the Advisory Board Internet Society Netherlands and Scientific technical advisory board of SURF Netherlands.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Obscura Day is a global event in which Atlas Obscura celebrates exploration and discovery with more than 150 curious and awe-inspiring real-world expeditions in 35+ states and 20+ countries, all on a single day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obscura Day is designed to make explorers out of everyone, and to reveal the hidden treasures in your own hometown. This year that includes everything from a sunrise falconry exhibition in the California desert to an excursion to the sacred Hindu caves of Goa Gajah, Bali to a private orchestral performance at the Robotic Church in Brooklyn, and much, much more. The whole roster of events can be found at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.atlasobscura.com_obscuraday2015&amp;amp;d=AwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=8hUWFZcy2Z-Za5rBPlktOQ&amp;amp;r=r5vA8KQthNivwNDqzwwoFTca94XmJ5-HU3-iT9NiiEw&amp;amp;m=RC1a8zEYBO7GM6JHTLJgX2DLObkejHw-nJsdSSQK3OM&amp;amp;s=BNqHWq8AtK_rbk8ntF_hvVNg4WXoNjfFPN-HQWsC7mM&amp;amp;e="&gt;www.atlasobscura.com/obscuraday2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCSA is taking part in Obscura Day by offering a tour of the Blue Waters supercomputer, one of the largest and most powerful supercomputers in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour begins at 1 pm -- because this is an access-controlled facility, it's important to be prompt (or a little early)! A tour guide will meet you at the front entrance (which is at the corner of Oak and St. Mary's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Register for the tour in advance at: &lt;a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/events/obscura-day-2015-behind-the-scenes-at-the-blue-waters-supercomputer"&gt;http://www.atlasobscura.com/events/obscura-day-2015-behind-the-scenes-at-the-blue-waters-supercomputer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
