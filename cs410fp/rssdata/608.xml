            <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in animals, medicine, and science? Do you like helping people? Do you like unraveling mysteries? Do you like real challenges? If you answered yes to these questions, then the wide world of veterinary medicine just may be for you. Veterinarians have a strong interest and ability in science. They enjoy working with people as well as with animals. Take a step into the world of veterinary medicine and see what veterinary school is like, learn about the different aspects of veterinary medicine, and more. You will learn about the science of veterinary medicine, anatomy, immunology, bacteriology, parasitology, wildlife medicine, large and small animal medicine, and more. You will participate in clinical equine rounds, streak and read bacteriology slides, learn about veterinary specialty fields such as dentistry, ophthalmology, and forensic pathology, and so much more&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
