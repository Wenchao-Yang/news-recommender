        <link>http://illinois.edu/calendar/list/4596</link>
        <description>Calendar for the largest or special events targeted towards the widest campus-community audience. This was created so special Beckman events will be pulled into the Illinois General Events calendar. The manager of this Illinois calendar requires sub-calendars to only list special events that appeal to a very large audience.</description>
