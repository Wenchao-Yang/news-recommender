            <description>&lt;p&gt;Professor Thomas Schwandt has devoted his career to encouraging evaluators and other social inquirers to think critically about their professional practice, to engage meaningfully with ideas from multiple domains of human endeavor, and to anchor professional actions in ethical and moral reasoning. Professor Schwandt&amp;rsquo;s voice has been a highly distinctive one amidst a loud chorus dominated by methodological issues and technical debates. This symposium will honor Professor Schwandt&amp;rsquo;s irreplaceable contributions to social inquiry across many fields and will celebrate his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symposium will feature presentations by invited colleagues, students, and friends of Tom&amp;rsquo;s, from all around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
