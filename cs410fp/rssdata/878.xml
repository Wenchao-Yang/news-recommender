            <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Opening Reception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, May 9 &amp;middot; 5&amp;ndash;7 pm&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual exhibition of works by graduates from the School of Art + Design's Bachelor of Fine Arts programs represents the full range of contemporary art and design practices. Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this exhibition displays works from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the permanent collection that directly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reference canonical works of art,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specific artists, and art historical styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some artists convey a sense of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adoration for their subject&amp;mdash;playfully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or with great reverence&amp;mdash;while others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use their works to critique society,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;religion, or even the art historical canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While focusing on works from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1960s through the early 2000s, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition highlights artists such as Vija&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celmins, Salvador Dal&amp;iacute;, Marlene Dumas,&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this exhibition displays works from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the permanent collection that directly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reference canonical works of art,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specific artists, and art historical styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some artists convey a sense of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adoration for their subject&amp;mdash;playfully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or with great reverence&amp;mdash;while others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use their works to critique society,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;religion, or even the art historical canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While focusing on works from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1960s through the early 2000s, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition highlights artists such as Vija&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="comment-text "&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan. During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woodcut in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Curator: &amp;nbsp;Anne Burkus-Chasson, Associate Professor in the School of Art + Design and the Departments of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, and Center for Global Studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will have two accompanying programs during Spring semester of 2015: Film Screening (7pm, February 19) "ANPO: Art X War" and an Artist Talk and Demonstration (5:30pm, April 2) "Japanese Paper: Beyond Substrate" featuring Lee Running, associate professor of Sculpture and Drawing at Grinnell College with a specialization in hand-papermaking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga, literally &amp;ldquo;prints made by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their creator,&amp;rdquo; although this term is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ordinarily translated as &amp;ldquo;creative prints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition features the work of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sosaku hanga artists from the late 1950s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and 1960s. To clarify their singular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manipulations of the print medium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of traditional ukiyo-e and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern shin hanga are also on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of foreign print artists who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked in Japan&amp;mdash;Paul Jacoulet and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton Karhu&amp;mdash;underscores both the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity that modern Japanese prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired and the enduring identity of&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois faculty within the detail+FABRICATION program of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the School of Architecture are actively exploring the role of fabrication and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than privileging finished products, objects, or built work, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designers are placing an increased focus on the process of making as a means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for surveying alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of this exhibition features the work of three faculty members who have explored the conception and evolution of ideas manifested in physical form during the past year. The models they present were created as part of competition entries, successful grants, and collaborations with architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component to "Speculative Visions" is the exhibition of work by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Hemingway, associate professor of Architecture. "Erik Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernism" documents his process of &amp;ldquo;Modernism as Preservation&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mid-century residences located in California and Illinois, including several&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;designed by A. Quincy Jones, Mies van der Rohe, and John Replinger. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exhibition of Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s design and preservation work will attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise awareness in saving lesser known modernist homes and highlight the history of their regional design importance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Printmaking flourished in Japan during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Allied Occupation (1945&amp;ndash;52), despite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the devastation of the war. Woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints&amp;mdash;together with dolls, fans, silks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sake cups&amp;mdash;were sought after as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;souvenirs among the nearly half million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American soldiers stationed in Occupied&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan. During the Cold War that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed, museums and collectors in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the United States and Europe actively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promoted the work of contemporary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese printmakers, following the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example of late nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aficionados of ukiyo-e (&amp;ldquo;pictures of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the floating world&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century Japanese woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints presented collectors with striking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diversity. Commercial publishing houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produced shin hanga (&amp;ldquo;new prints&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular during the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shin hanga adhered to the familiar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idioms of ukiyo-e. By contrast, Onchi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koshiro (1891&amp;ndash;1955) and members of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his print society emulated the pioneering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work of Yamamoto Kanae (1882&amp;ndash;1946),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who made &amp;ldquo;knife pictures&amp;rdquo; on his own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without the support of a publisher, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who in 1918 helped to establish the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihon sosaku hanga kyokai (Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Print Association). Koshiro and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his followers later experimented with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly every aspect of woodblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;printing, while adhering to the basic tenet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that woodcuts be carved and printed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their makers. Hence, their work is called&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This conference is hosted by the Housing and Built Environment Research Committee of the International Sociological Association (RC43).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing economic inequality and socio-spatial polarization challenge both developed and developing countries. Housing policy stands at a crossroads--will our housing systems widen or close the gap between those with means and those without? Will residential neighborhoods serve as social and economic melting pots, or will they harden the boundaries reflective of the growing wealth and power of elite social groups? What should be done and what can be done are very different questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can housing markets and policies better serve as one of the important factors promoting social outcomes in which all have fairer access to the opportunities and benefits that cities and neighborhoods provide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Call &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The RC43 encourages cross-disciplinary debate and welcomes housing research papers from all social science disciplines. We invite both panel session proposals and individual abstracts related to the following themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing markets, structural crises, and socio-spatial outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of housing policy in socio-spatial inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparative contexts: housing system diversity and/or convergence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing and social theory in a globalized, neoliberal era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social/public housing strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changing role of the private rented sector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neighborhood socio-spatial change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing through the lifecourse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers should be 5,000 to 8,000 words inclusive. Sessions are two hours long, and can have up to five papers. Individual presentations should be 15 minutes long.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The deadline for abstracts is March 15, 2015. Abstracts should be submitted via email to &lt;a href="mailto:isa.rc43@gmail.com"&gt;isa.rc43@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a pre-conference for PhD students on September 16, 2015. More information on this day will be coming soon; please check the website for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Housing in an Unequal World conference is organized by the RC43 in collaboration with the University of Illinois-Chicago, and the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
