            <description>&lt;p&gt;For over a century, the University of Illinois has played a leading role in the promotion of educational exchange with China. UI President Edmund James was a leader in the movement to open US universities to Chinese students in 1906, when US policy toward China was very restrictive in this area. This exhibit tells the story of how James&amp;#8217;s vision led the University of Illinois to become one of the most significant destinations for Chinese students during the early decades of the 20th century. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an important part of the Chinese culture. Acupuncture, as an important part of TCM, and an effective, safe, and widely applicable natural treatment, has been accepted by more than 160 countries. This lecture introduces some basic theories and ideas behind TCM, including the flow of Qi (Chi) and blood in the channel system of the human body, how illness is explained by the interruptions of the body's points and channels, and how acupuncture is thought to provide effective treatments to certain illnesses by regulating and stimulating the flow of Qi in the channel system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Present-moment awareness can be elusive and it can be easy to become distracted or lost in thought.&amp;nbsp; Through the training and practice of mindful meditation, one can discover a calm and more fully appreciate the gift of each day. Mary Wolters from Green Yoga Spa will lead free, 30-minute mindful meditation sessions in the Knight Auditorium at the Spurlock Museum.&amp;nbsp; No registration is necessary, participants may attend as many or few sessions as they like.&amp;nbsp; The series continues each Friday, 11:30 - 12:00, through May 8th.&amp;nbsp; Metered parking is typically readily available around the museum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Nugent is credited with founding the department during his 38-year career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Lavizzo-Mourey&amp;rsquo;s speech to graduates will be &amp;ldquo;It's Your Turn &amp;ndash; Building a Culture of Health in America.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The message mirrors the life mission of Lavizzo-Mourey, who took the helm of RWJF 10 years ago and oversees an endowment of more than $8 billion that is used to fund more than $400 million each year in projects focused on health and wellness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Most recently, the foundation doubled a $500 million commitment made in 2007 to battle childhood obesity, with an array of national programs emphasizing better access for children to healthy foods and physical activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our goal is to ensure that everyone, no matter where they live or how much money they have, has the opportunity to make healthy choices and live a healthy life,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Commencement 2015 will be the second consecutive outdoor ceremony for the U. of I., and follows the start of extensive renovations last year to State Farm Center, the traditional venue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Laura Wilhelm-Barr, the director of special events, said information on other Commencement-related events, including convocation and reception details, shuttle bus schedules and ticket distribution, can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.commencement.illinois.edu/"&gt;www.commencement.illinois.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The campuswide Commencement ceremony is the official University of Illinois academic ceremony at which the Chancellor presides and the President confers degrees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Doctoral degree candidates are individually recognized. Bachelor's and Master's degree recipients stand as a group at their seats and are recognized by college. This is a dignified ceremony held in Memorial Stadium that lasts about two and a half hours. Academic attire is required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;This year's speaker is &lt;span style="color: #000080; font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt;Lani Guinier&lt;/span&gt;, Professor of Law, Harvard University. &lt;span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt;In 1998, Lani Guinier became the first black woman to be appointed to a tenured professorship at Harvard Law School. Before joining the faculty at Harvard, she was a tenured professor for 10 years at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. During the 1980s she was head of the voting rights project at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and had served in the Civil Rights Division during the Carter administration as special assistant to Drew S. Days, who then was an assistant U.S. attorney general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt; Guinier came to prominent public attention when she was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1993 to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, only to have her name withdrawn without a confirmation hearing. Guinier turned that incident into a powerful personal and political memoir, "Lift Every Voice: Turning a Civil Rights Setback Into a New Vision of Social Justice."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; While a member of the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Guinier investigated the experience of women in law school, leading to the publication of a book, "Becoming Gentlemen: Women, Law School and Institutional Change." She and her co-authors found that women were not graduating with top honors, although women and men came to the school with virtually identical credentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; A graduate of Radcliffe College of Harvard University and Yale Law School, Guinier has received numerous awards, including the 1995 Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award from the American Bar Association&amp;rsquo;s Commission on Women in the Profession and the Rosa Parks Award from the American Association for Affirmative Action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Exhibit: South Asian Seams: Quilts from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
