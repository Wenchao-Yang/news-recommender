            <description>&lt;p&gt;For over a century, the University of Illinois has played a leading role in the promotion of educational exchange with China. UI President Edmund James was a leader in the movement to open US universities to Chinese students in 1906, when US policy toward China was very restrictive in this area. This exhibit tells the story of how James&amp;#8217;s vision led the University of Illinois to become one of the most significant destinations for Chinese students during the early decades of the 20th century. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The CITES No Change period is designed to minimize the number of technical disruptions that might occur around final exams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning on Reading Day and continuing a few days past the end of finals, CITES tries to make no technical changes to hardware or software that might disrupt the availability of the campus network, data storage, web sites or any of the software-based services that CITES provides to campus. Changes or updates will only be made by CITES for emergency purposes during the No Change period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an important part of the Chinese culture. Acupuncture, as an important part of TCM, and an effective, safe, and widely applicable natural treatment, has been accepted by more than 160 countries. This lecture introduces some basic theories and ideas behind TCM, including the flow of Qi (Chi) and blood in the channel system of the human body, how illness is explained by the interruptions of the body's points and channels, and how acupuncture is thought to provide effective treatments to certain illnesses by regulating and stimulating the flow of Qi in the channel system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
