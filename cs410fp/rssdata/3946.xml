            <title>ECE Colloquium (ECE 500): "Electrification - with great power comes great responsibility"</title>
            <link>http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/3946/32381157</link>

            <guid isPermaLink="true">http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/3946/32381157</guid>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Electrification technologies are entering a renaissance &amp;ndash; and Power technologies are in the middle of it. With this renaissance also come accelerating demands on the pace of development, value to the user, and a need for multi-disciplinary integration.&amp;nbsp;It is the responsibility of the contemporary engineer to be aware of all these factors. &amp;nbsp;In this talk, I will discuss examples of power technologies driving this renaissance, and how these factors are changing the way we design and develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Oliver originated from England before moving to Canada at the age of 15 where he went on to complete a PhD in Electrical Engineering at McGill University in Montreal. After university, Oliver joined GE Global Research (GRC) working primarily on R&amp;amp;D for Healthcare. During this time, he was privileged to lead teams that transitioned multiple new electrical system technologies into GE Healthcare&amp;rsquo;s Computer Tomography (CT) machines that impacted performance, simplicity, and cost. These technologies developed and integrated mixed-signal ASICs, advanced electrical packaging, and the controls that convert x-ray&amp;rsquo;s passed through the body into a digital format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, after holding positions leading GE&amp;rsquo;s MicroSystem&amp;rsquo;s technology lab and technology portfolios for GE Industrial and Oil &amp;amp; Gas businesses, Oliver became the Technology Leader for the Power Conversion and Delivery organization at GRC. This 80-person team develops technology that converts motion into electricity, converts and distributes electricity across GE systems, and transforms electricity back into motion. Focus areas include: Power Electronics applications that span power from 5 Watts to 20MW, electric machine development that includes harsh environment and high reliability applications, and power systems that optimize grid controls and interactions with a focus on renewables and energy storage. Business applications range from Oil &amp;amp; Gas, Healthcare, Aviation, Industrial Systems, and Energy Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his career Oliver has been challenged to build teams that develop innovative technologies that can be successfully transitioned and scaled to improve the outcomes for GE customers. This also includes coaching technology teams to adopt Lean Start-up principles within GE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of GE, Oliver is kept busy with his wife and two children, a 14-year old son, and an 11-year old daughter. To balance his interests with his children, he takes the family skiing, drives (and repairs) his 1970 MGB convertible with them, and has been cooking with both children since they were very young.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
