            <description>&lt;p&gt;The CITES No Change period is designed to minimize the number of technical disruptions that might occur around final exams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning on Reading Day and continuing a few days past the end of finals, CITES tries to make no technical changes to hardware or software that might disrupt the availability of the campus network, data storage, web sites or any of the software-based services that CITES provides to campus. Changes or updates will only be made by CITES for emergency purposes during the No Change period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
