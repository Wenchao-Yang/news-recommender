            <description>&lt;p&gt;When you offer a course, you are essentially promising your students that if they come to class, work hard, and fulfill all of the requirements you set out for them, then they will learn something valuable. It is therefore essential to make sure your course fulfills that promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this hour, you will be introduced to a method of course design that will help ensure proper alignment of course objectives, assessments, activities, and policies in such a way that students are likely to learn and succeed. You will also be introduced to the knowledge dimension of Bloom&amp;rsquo;s Taxonomy, which will assist you in determining the kinds of learning you want your students to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the pedagogical skills a teacher can have, the ability to write clear, motivating, and useful learning objectives is among the most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this hour, you will be introduced to the cognitive process dimension of Bloom&amp;rsquo;s Taxonomy, and will learn how to use that as a tool for writing useful and engaging objectives for your course, units within your course, and lessons within those units.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Grading Fairly and Efficiently with Rubrics</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;If you grade poorly, you are in for a rough ride, be it because you are spending way too much time making sure you get everything right, or because you did not get everything right and you have a line of upset students outside your door. Rubrics can help you grade well. They clarify your expectations for your students, help you grade more quickly, make sure every student is held to the same standard, reduce the number of comments you need to write, and help adjudicate grade disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this hour, you will learn what rubrics are and why to use them, what tools are available to help you create rubrics, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get some practice creating a rubric.&lt;/p&gt;
