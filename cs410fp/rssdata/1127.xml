            <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an important part of the Chinese culture. Acupuncture, as an important part of TCM, and an effective, safe, and widely applicable natural treatment, has been accepted by more than 160 countries. This lecture introduces some basic theories and ideas behind TCM, including the flow of Qi (Chi) and blood in the channel system of the human body, how illness is explained by the interruptions of the body's points and channels, and how acupuncture is thought to provide effective treatments to certain illnesses by regulating and stimulating the flow of Qi in the channel system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
