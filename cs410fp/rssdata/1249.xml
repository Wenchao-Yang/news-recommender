            <description>&lt;p&gt;For over a century, the University of Illinois has played a leading role in the promotion of educational exchange with China. UI President Edmund James was a leader in the movement to open US universities to Chinese students in 1906, when US policy toward China was very restrictive in this area. This exhibit tells the story of how James&amp;#8217;s vision led the University of Illinois to become one of the most significant destinations for Chinese students during the early decades of the 20th century. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiltmaking is an integral and vital part of South Asian culture. Much the same as here in the West, quilts serve both functional and symbolic purposes. They provide warmth as well as a comfortable place to sit; and they also commemorate special occasions and tell the stories of the lives of their makers. The seams that bring together different pieces of fabric in a quilt also represent the seams that bring together this vast region&amp;mdash;its people, its cultures, and its shared tradition of extraordinary textiles. The exhibit will be on display&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, February 17&amp;ndash;Saturday, August 1. The exhibit is open Museum hours: Tuesdays 12-5, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays 9-5, Saturdays 10-4, and Sundays 12-4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Present-moment awareness can be elusive and it can be easy to become distracted or lost in thought.&amp;nbsp; Through the training and practice of mindful meditation, one can discover a calm and more fully appreciate the gift of each day. Mary Wolters from Green Yoga Spa will lead free, 30-minute mindful meditation sessions in the Knight Auditorium at the Spurlock Museum.&amp;nbsp; No registration is necessary, participants may attend as many or few sessions as they like.&amp;nbsp; The series continues each Friday, 11:30 - 12:00, through May 8th.&amp;nbsp; Metered parking is typically readily available around the museum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
