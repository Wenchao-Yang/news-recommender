About Dump &amp; Run: Dump &amp; Run is a fundraising program that the University Y has been doing for the past 11 years. Its basic concept is simple: we collect reusable items, which students would otherwise dispose of as they move out, and then sell the collected items at our Annual Garage Sale in late August. This project reduces litter and consumer waste, saves space in landfills, lowers dumping costs for certified housing units, provides inexpensive items for students to purchase in the fall, and acts as a great fundraiser for the University YMCA, Champaign County's oldest charity.

We do NOT collect: stoves, washers, dryers, non-working electronics and computer parts, sleeper sofas, mattresses, and large exercise equipment. The Habitat for Humanity store downtown Champaign may be able to take your donations of stoves, washers, dryers, sleeper sofas, and exercise equipment.

We collect:  We will only accept clothing that is in nearly-new condition. Other than that, we will take just about anything ranging from furniture, working electronics, backpacks, bicycles, school supplies, jewelry, winter clothing, shoes, kitchen appliances, glassware, CDs/records (vinyl!!), books, working computers, artwork, toys, sporting equipment, non-perishable food items, toiletries, lawn and garden items, and other household goods. If you think an item may not be in good enough condition to be resold, give it to us anyway. Hopefully we can find it a home!

Additional Information: Volunteer for 6 hours or more and receive first dibs on all Dump &amp; Run items! For more information or to sign up to volunteer, please visit:www.universityymca.org/dumpandrun</description>
