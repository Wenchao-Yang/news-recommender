            <description>&lt;p&gt;The Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) is sponsoring a Research Travel Grant competition for undergraduate students seeking to conduct research outside of the University of Illinois campus. The goals for this initiative are to provide students with funds necessary to conduct on-site research at an archive, lab, research center, museum, or a location that has materials not readily available at UI. The Office of Undergraduate Research recognizes that UI students are conducting cutting edge research on campus, but that funding for research travel is sometimes lacking. We hope that this competition will both broaden and deepen the type of research being conducted by undergraduate students on campus, and that the recipients are able to use this opportunity as a way of engaging with their fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no deadline for applications, but they must be submitted no later than six weeks prior to &amp;nbsp;the dates of the travel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
