            <description>&lt;p&gt;Accessibility can sometimes be very abstract and we might not completely understand how users with disabilities will be affected by our designs or if we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a technique correctly. The monthly "Explore with Hadi" meeting is a place where we can evaluate these things together, identify any issues and hopefully find solutions together to address accessibility/usability issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Explore with Hadi discussion is held on the second Tuesday of each month. It is an informal gathering where web developers can bring their accessibility questions to an open dialog. We will examine how potential accessibility issues in the web development process can impact a wide range of disabilities. This includes looking at the overall design, determining how screen reading software shows the page, discuss usability issues and best practices using HTML/CSS/Javascript and how to incorporate the latest accessibility techniques like WAI ARIA. We strive to present an overall universal design approach to help you not only improve web sites and applications but also gain a more informed understanding of what that takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this takes place in a friendly, comfortable environment where we will even offer coffee and refreshments! The discussion is always instructive and helpful in bringing best practices and techniques to light in a practical, hands-on format. If you can&amp;rsquo;t participate physically, joining by phone is also possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Tuesday of each month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:00 AM to 12:00 PM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location and phone-in information is provided in announcements on the CCSP, Webmaster, and Accessibility mailing lists&amp;nbsp;approximately one week prior to the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Explore with Hadi is primarily targeted to campus developers, we also welcome developers from the community. If you are interested in getting involved in&amp;nbsp;our discussion,&amp;nbsp;we recommend you join the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://lists.illinois.edu/lists/info/accessibility" target="_blank"&gt;Accessibility mailing list&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;so you will receive our monthly announcements. We look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
